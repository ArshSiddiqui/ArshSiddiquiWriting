I haven\u0026rsquo;t read very many books about war, WW1 included, so this was definitely a great introduction.\nThe story itself is based upon Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s time serving as an ambulance driver working for the Italian military, where he had met a nurse he\u0026rsquo;d fallen in love with. I won\u0026rsquo;t say much more nor how his tale differs from the book itself, but keeping that in mind made the book (and the twists and turns of the story itself) more interesting.\nOne thing I really enjoyed about the story was the nature of the characters in terms of the wider scope of the narrative. Deaths being both tragic and meaningless at the same time often came into the foray, and mingled with useless murder. Hearing individuals discuss and debate the virtues (namely the lack thereof) of their situations gave more of a \u0026ldquo;what is it good for\u0026rdquo; flavor to the story that I, for one, appreciated.\nThis is definitely a great book that I would highly recommend.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/bookreviews/ataleoftwocities/","title":"A Tale of Two Cities","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rA Tale of Two Cities\r#\rCharles Dickens\r#\rNovember 17, 2021\n5/5\nI bought this book on a whim about a year ago, but didn\u0026rsquo;t start reading it till not long ago. I was told by a good friend that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that it was chopped up to be, so I went in with little thought.\nI will say that the book began kind of slowly, but I enjoyed it all the same. At the halfway point, when the French Revolution begins is when the book really picks up steam, and it was at this point when I could not put the book down.\nPotential spoilers following\nSitting in history class learning about the French Revolution and the horrors of the Rein of Terror is one thing for certain. It is easy to throw around statistics of deaths of the time, but using statistics to represent deaths is unfair in some sense. This book really made me feel for all those lives lost and families unnecessarily impacted by the Revolution. The final chapter, and the final few paragraphs are truly something to behold, and left me a little sad I daresay.\nI highly recommend this read, it is a great book, there is no doubt about that in my mind.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/bookreviews/crying_in_hmart/","title":"Crying In H Mart","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rCrying In H Mart\r#\rMichelle Zauner\r#\rJanuary 6, 2024\n5/5\nThis is fully the first book I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if it stays the best book I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I really have the words to describe this book.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll say that it\u0026rsquo;s one of the saddest books I\u0026rsquo;ve read before and one of the few books I could very genuinely feel. In two ways. The two primary ways I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about this book was in one sense in terms of the primary story itself, and then additionally in terms of race.\nAlthough I myself am not mixed race, my appearance is not commonly viewed with the perception of my race. A lot of what I felt like growing up in terms of my own race to what I feel today mirrors what the author feels. And then the juxtaposition of that with respect to, in her case, one of her parents, felt very real.

I\u0026rsquo;d heard of this book around the time I was reading that and it was described as one of the best American plays. I\u0026rsquo;ve finally gotten around to reading it and I can certainly agree with that claim.\nI think that a lot of us, or at least me, spend a lot of time and hope that we will go on to be successful in some way or another in our lives, and we put a lot of thought into it. I try to convince myself that it\u0026rsquo;s both hard to measure success and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to be successful, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to rewire my brain like that.\nThis novel certainly echoes a lot of the inner monologue I had going on for a while, and it was both comforting and terrifying to read about it in the novel. The novel describes the story of one man\u0026rsquo;s life, his trials and tribulations, and his frustrations all in one day. Reading it all out like that certainly gave me a lot to think about my life, and what I saw for myself in the future. Though, to be frank, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what to think about my life or existence.\nThe book is a great read, and it is a fantastic description of a human life in the modern day.

Indeed, it is about an old man reminiscing upon his life, and all the decisions he has made in it. How time has ravaged and somehow has not forgot. How human nature can be unchanging.\nIt feels to me, though, not like many stories I have read before. It is unique by its very nature, and by the concerns it chooses to tackle. I think this is to its benefit, and I can certainly say it is a fantastic novel. Though, I also daresay that in some ways it really does feel more like a guide to ageing than it does feel like a classic story.\nIt is certainly thought provoking on the issue of age and on the issue of death.

All that I have read of Hemingway I have enjoyed very much, his style of writing just feels extremely natural, funny enough. It really makes all of the internal monologue just go by smoothly because that sort of internal monologue feels natural in the way it has been written, like a real internal monologue.\nMuch of this book is written in that deign, thus making the writing itself an absolute joy to take in.\nThe story is brilliant as well, of course. It is easy to imagine the single track mind one may have at many phases of life, or when one has received friction from another, but the duality of much experiences is something one mustn\u0026rsquo;t forget. It was interesting for me to see butchery in this way, both in the lens of what \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; did and what \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; did. This may be obvious to many, but I would have had a horse in this race so to speak, so a lot of my mind would be blind to that.\nThere is no need for me really to reflect on the tragedy of war here, that\u0026rsquo;s what this story (and many others) and there for.\nI can only recommend this book.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/technical/generatedpoe/","title":"Generated Poe-try","section":"Technical","content":"\rEdgar Allen Poe-try\r#\rthe day broke it\nso strong and a willingness\nto let it atone\nI have been interested in language modeling for a while, and I have done many projects in that realm in the past. Firstly, langauge modeling is the use of a technique to determine the probablility of a sentence occuring with the words in it in that order. It is frequently used to create computer algorithms that will create intelligible sentences based upon some text corpus.\nI first began working with language models with the bag of words method, which simply categorizes all of the words in some given text into it based upon their appearance in the text. We can then take this categorization and output a randomized string of words based upon some randomness and word commonality. Using this method created sentences like this:\ntoo, no best than about clearly in know of in made of the the side one the of and the are customer From spots having found majority, from was been I-as Touch-me-Not a double The having armed dropped rank but which mer_. well week-once\nYeah, it isn\u0026rsquo;t very good, but it was a start. I then moved on to n-gram models. This effectively takes n - 1 words and uses them to predict the next word. So say we have a bi-gram (2-gram), this means that we can take a sentence and break it upon into groups of two words:\nThere is a dog named Allen.\n[ (There, is), (is, a), (a, dog), (dog, named), (named, Allen) ]\nUsing the occurences of bundled words together, when we give an algorithm a word, it can determine what comes next based upon the previous word (what normally comes up based upon our text corpus). I attemped to create an algorithm that worked based upon this method a while ago, though I believe that I created it incorrectly or did it poorly, because the final sentences again weren\u0026rsquo;t that great:\nno psyche within none within hair of like i brilliant i of thee in shore vogue land shore the native thy seas too whole grandeur agate thee stand inner long its here scorn ere scorn was byron which it safely remarkable estimate teens can none grandeur withering lamp withering\nI did, much later get back into language modeling. For a class project, a friend and I decided to create a trigram model, which is effectively the same as a bigram model but with n = 3. So that previous sentence would be broken down like this:\nThere is a dog named Allen.\n[ (There, is, a), (is, a, dog), (a, dog, named), (dog, named, Allen) ]\nSo instead of looking at the previous word to determine the next word, we would look at the previous two words to determine the next, and so on so forth. For this project (and all the previous), we used a library called nltk. This effectively just makes created all those bigrams and trigams much easier than they would otherwise be, and they make creating the models much easier. Our final product ended up being much better than the previous examples, as the following sentences exhibits (note that we used the novel \u0026ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo\u0026rdquo; for our text corpus here, whereas for the previous projects I had used a text corpus of Edgar Allen Poe stories):\nand then drew himself up with happiness, looking for all that you had conveyed a packet for Marshal Bertrand.\nthe night of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the city.\nYeah, those sentences aren\u0026rsquo;t that bad, I think.\nMore recently, I wanted to try to use a similar trigram algorithm on Edgar Allen Poe writing to create haikus. This would, of course, not only require text generation, but also need to have a way to convert the sentences that my text generation algorithm would create into haikus. Before I go on too far into that, let\u0026rsquo;s first look at the trigram model itself. Firstly, we need to open the text file and create the model:\nmodel = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: 0)) file = open(\u0026#34;EAPStories.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) The second line just opens the text file to be read only, while the first line creates the base for the model itself. Effectively what it is doing is creating a dictionary within a dictionary. This allows us to pair two words together to determine what the next possible words could be.\nfor line in file: for w1, w2, w3 in trigrams(line.lower().split(), pad_right=True, pad_left=True): model[(w1, w2)][w3] += 1 total_occurence = 0 for occurence in model[\u0026#39;the\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;day\u0026#39;].values(): total_occurence += occurence for w1w2 in model: for w3 in model[w1w2]: model[w1w2][w3] = model[w1w2][w3] / total_occurence dict(model[\u0026#39;and\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;then\u0026#39;]) {\u0026#39;went\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;obtain\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;: 0.12121212121212122,\r\u0026#39;returned,\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;from\u0026#39;: 0.030303030303030304,\r\u0026#39;caught\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;the\u0026#39;: 0.16666666666666666,\r\u0026#39;universal\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;felt\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\rNone: 0.12121212121212122,\r...\r\u0026#39;producing\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152} This code firstly goes through every line in the text file and splits the words up in very similar fashion to that of the \u0026ldquo;There is a dog named Allen\u0026rdquo; example I\u0026rsquo;d previously shown. The rest of the code takes every single possible third word to the first two words in the trigram, and determines the probability and word will come next based upon the total number of possibilities. This can be seen in the output, which is showing all of the possible concluding words to the two words \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;then\u0026rdquo;. Each word is correlated to a probability of its occurence. The \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; which can be seen as well just dictates the end of the sentence.\ndef create_sentence(word1, word2): sentence = [word1, word2] sentence_complete = False total_words = 0 num_words = 2 while not sentence_complete: min_words = random.random() for word in model[tuple(sentence[num_words - 2:])].keys(): total_words += model[tuple(sentence[num_words - 2:])][word] if total_words \u0026gt;= min_words: sentence.append(word) num_words += 1 break if sentence[num_words - 2:] == [None, None]: sentence_complete = True sentence_str = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for word in sentence: if word != None: sentence_str = sentence_str + word + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;create_sentence:\u0026#34;, sentence_str) return sentence While analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively. Here, we can also use some Python to calculate the returns between our start and end date and we can also use this to determine an average return across each year (or month if we wanted to do that as well).\ndays = 1000 years = days / 365 final_returns = 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1)[-1] print(\u0026#39;Return from start date to end date is: \u0026#39; + \u0026#39;{:.2f}\u0026#39;.format(final_returns) + \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) final_returns_per_year = final_returns / years print(\u0026#39;Average yearly return: \u0026#39; + \u0026#39;{:.2f}\u0026#39;.format(final_returns_per_year) + \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) Return from start date to end date is: 178.52%\rAverage yearly return: 65.16% This is finally the code that creates our sentences. What we are effectively doing is setting a random probability that we want each of our next words to achieve at a threshold. Then we continuously add these words to a list that will become our sentence. The sentence ends once we hit the word \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; (which refers to no word) twice.\nThis is similar to what we had done for the Monte Cristo trigam model, but I have changed some of the methods involved for simplicities sake.\nThe rest of the program will generate a sentence using the above function, checks how many syllables are in each word, and then attempt to create the three haiku lines with those words in their proper order. If it can\u0026rsquo;t, it scraps that sentence and generates a new one. This keeps going until a haiku is created. You can see one of the haikus that the algorithm generated at the top of this page.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/technical/los_angeles_grocery_stores/","title":"Grocery Stores in Los Angeles","section":"Technical","content":"\rGrocery Stores in Los Angeles\r#\rJanuary 3, 2024\nQuite a while ago, I had taken a class at my university that covered a range of design based topics, one such relating to food scarcity and food deserts. According to Wikipedia, a food desert is \u0026ldquo;an area that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food\u0026rdquo;. To continue my work involving osmnx, I figured it might be interesting to consider areas in a city that might classify as a food desert, though I\u0026rsquo;ll use a much more fast and loose definition of a food desert here, simply due to my level of urban analysis, my patience, and the data available with respect to my knowledge of how to deal with it.\nThis time, I have decided to target Los Angeles, after having spent a few days there. My data comes from Los Angeles City Data, and is this dataset in particular. This is a listing of all \u0026ldquo;active grocery stores currently registered with the Office of Finance\u0026rdquo;. Now, some of these grocery stores might be unaffordable, and some of them may not provide nutritious food. I can\u0026rsquo;t say for certain whether these grocery stores might exist in a food desert or if their existence disallows the existence of a food desert in their area, I\u0026rsquo;m just doing an experiment.\nWe can begin by getting the graph of Los Angeles itself along with its nodes and edges.\nla = \u0026#34;Los Angeles, CA, USA\u0026#34; network_type = \u0026#34;walk\u0026#34; G = ox.graph_from_place(la, network_type=network_type) nodes, edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G) We can also take a look at our data itself.\ngroceries = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;Grocery_Stores_20240102.csv\u0026#39;) LOCATION ACCOUNT # BUSINESS NAME DBA NAME STREET ADDRESS CITY ZIP CODE LOCATION DESCRIPTION MAILING ADDRESS MAILING CITY MAILING ZIP CODE NAICS PRIMARY NAICS DESCRIPTION COUNCIL DISTRICT LOCATION START DATE LOCATION END DATE LOCATION 0 0002754901-0002-3 MOISES CLEMENTE THE REAL SNACK STORE 5526 AVALON BLVD LOS ANGELES 90011-5116 5526 AVALON 90011-5116 nan nan nan 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 9 02/02/2015 nan (33.9922, -118.2651) 1 0002869486-0001-4 LETS WORK ALL INC 7-ELEVEN STORE 39763A 3079 N SAN FERNANDO ROAD LOS ANGELES 90065-1410 3079 SAN FERNANDO 90065-1410 POST OFFICE BOX #219088 DALLAS 75221-9088 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 13 01/01/2016 nan (34.1144, -118.2454) 2 0002870509-0001-8 MAURA CALIXTO VELAZQUEZ VELAZQUEZ MINI MARKET 8504 S BROADWAY LOS ANGELES 90003-3335 8504 BROADWAY 90003-3335 nan nan nan 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 9 11/19/2015 nan (33.9614, -118.2782) We can go ahead and use the LOCATION column in this data table as our means of getting access to the latitude and longitude positions of each of the grocery stores, but first we need to convert these into tuples for ease of use, as they are currently formatted as strings.\ngrocery_loc = groceries[\u0026#39;LOCATION\u0026#39;] grocery_loc_tup = [] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc)): try: grocery_loc_tup.append(tuple(map(float, grocery_loc[i][1:-1].split(\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;)))) except: pass Then we can find the nearest nodes to each of these grocery stores to estimate the node and osmid they would appear at. This is another limitation to consider.\nxs = [grocery_loc_tup[i][1] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc_tup))] ys = [grocery_loc_tup[i][0] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc_tup))] ids = ox.nearest_nodes(G, X=xs, Y=ys) Great! Now we have a set of osmids for each of our grocery stores that correspond to points in our initial graph of Los Angeles.\nThe rest of this is effectively just creating an isochrone graph. To do this I followed and adapted Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s method using osmnx. So much of the code that you will see as follows will be his or adjusted from his.\nFirstly though, we want to consider a few features. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this in terms of the walking distance from any particular grocery store and we\u0026rsquo;ll assume that the walking speed of an average person is indeed 4.5 km/hr. We can convert this to meters per minute and add the time it takes to traverse an edge on the graph to each edge:\nmpm = travel_speed * 1000 / 60 for u, v, k, data in G.edges(data=True, keys=True): data[\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;] = data[\u0026#39;length\u0026#39;] / mpm The next thing we will have to consider is trip times, which I\u0026rsquo;m going to consider similar to what was initially done in Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s method, but without a trip distance of 24 minutes considered, because that is quite a while one way. In this sense, we\u0026rsquo;ll consider 5 minutes at minimum and 20 minutes at maximum. We can get colors in the range of some colormap thus, to visualize a range of distances.\ntrip_times = [5, 10, 15, 20] iso_colors = ox.plot.get_colors(n=len(trip_times), cmap=\u0026#39;magma\u0026#39;, start=0, return_hex=True) We can get the colors of each of the individual nodes on the graph of Los Angeles using these iso_colors and by using each of the osmids we found to correlated to each of the groceries at \u0026ldquo;starting points\u0026rdquo;:\nnode_colors = {} for id in ids: for t, c in zip(sorted(trip_times, reverse=True), iso_colors): subgraph = nx.ego_graph(G, id, radius=t, distance=\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;) for node in subgraph.nodes(): node_colors[node] = c And then we can present it all, finally, in a graph, making sure to assign colors where necessary:\nWalking Distance to Grocery Stores in Los Angeles\rHmmmmmm. Evidently a lot of what Open Street Map considers to be Los Angeles is not covered by the data from Los Angeles. Or maybe my code was wrong! I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What I can see is that, of the areas that are covered by colors, a majority of it is within a good walking distance of a grocery store, with the exceptions in brighter areas. I can already notice an amount of problems Id like to come back and resolve, but I\u0026rsquo;m tired, so this will be it for now!\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/technical/headlinefrequency/headlinesentiment/","title":"Headline Sentiment","section":"Technical","content":"\rHeadline Sentiment\r#\rDue to the prevalence of the internet in our day to day lives, we often tend to read and view news articles in a manner different than we used to. Traditional news journalism was read or recieved through newspapers or some other form of once-daily edification. Now we no longer seek this form of keeping up to date with what is going on in the world, rather we tend to find information and news through articles online. Now, rather than articles being selected for users based upon their relevance and importance, these articles and authors need to find a way to make the user more likely to click on and read their writing. Many of these articles have maintained journalistic integrity in keeping with some set of standards, whereas some have tended towards other means of gaining user interest.\nMany make the claim online that some of the articles use strong emotions to make users more interested in the information therein. Either articles can have headlines that are very positive (happy inducing, perhaps) or negative (anger or sadness inducing, maybe).\nBased upon these claims, I was curious to see if I could potentially look at the headlines of many different news agencies and see if I could determine how much emotion was being utilized therein. I found that quite a majority of the articles that I had looked at were still fairly neutral, though there will still many an occasion of strong emotion persent.\nTo analyze emotions in text, I used vader sentiment analysis, and used the compound score it gave for each article (which is on a scale of -1 to 0 to 1, with -1 being the most negative emotionally, and 1 being the most positive emotionally) to create graphs for a number of news agencies on how they have utilized emotions in their headlines over time.\nI was also able to calculate the average compound sentiment score for each news agency. Interestingly, all of them skewed positive. While there were many articles that were both very positive and very negitive from all of the groups, the overall skew was still positive. However, most of the articles in every agency was neutral and very close to a score of 0.\nThere are some very important notes to make about the scores that I have, however, they are not tremendously accurate. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a news agency with three articles, each of which have a compound score of 0. Its average score then is a 0, and this is accurately reflected in its articles. What if it has three articles with scores of -1, 0, and 1? Then the average score would still be 0, but clearly they put out more emotionally charged (and perhaps divisive) articles. This bias, along with a lot more that I probably have not realized or accounted for, are likely to be prevalent in my scores.\nBelow, you will see a table with all of average scores, both compound, positive, and negative scores for each agency.\nAgency Compound Positive Negative The New York Times 0.0261689 0.0192063 0.0046609 Breitbart 0.02408299 0.02090032 0.00665240 CNN 0.03414162 0.02843440 0.00503824 Business Insider 0.06110852 0.03306334 0.00388264 The Atlantic 0.02058144 0.01716854 0.00356693 Fox News 0.04760875 0.03312206 0.00710000 Buzzfeed 0.03076971 0.02058508 0.00535929 The National Review 0.01993751 0.01858704 0.00496947 The New York Post 0.05131073 0.03820476 0.00518698 NPR 0.02992590 0.02032171 0.00449541 Vox 0.04143098 0.02530119 0.00403961 The Washington Post 0.03914736 0.02508142 0.00426336 Talking Points Memo 0.02116882 0.01664933 0.00484788 The Guardian 0.04446168 0.03017346 0.00564048 Reuters 0.05193949 0.03652189 0.00503184 From this table above, one can see that much of the data is fairly neutral in terms of emotion sparked.

One interesting consideration to have when it comes to playing Monopoly is to consider which squares are landed upon the most. I typically spend my games trying to purchase squares near the end of the board, because if anybody lands on them I get a higher payout, but is that mentality necessarily true?\nAs it turns out, no.\nWe might imagine that as we roll the die, there would be an even spread of chance for landing on any particular square on the board. This would be true if we never had external forces moving us around the board and if we were only following the whim of the die.\nConsider that if we roll doubles thrice, we go to jail, and there are special cards and circumstances that would send us back to the beginning of the board. This leads us to having a skew to the home position and to the jail location. Considering these pieces of information, upon exiting them with another role of the die, we may find a lot of our locations clustered around the following spots on the board.\nKnowing this information, we can then create a Python script that contains knowledge of all of the positions on the board and of all of the chance and community chest cards to effectively play the game some number of times counting up each spot we land on to determine which spots are landed upon the most frequently.\nThe following are the results that I have attained from the code:\nSquare Probability of Landing Jail / Just Visiting 6.7% Go 3.11% Reading Railroad 2.88% Illinois Avenue 2.82% St. Charles Place 2.73% Boardwalk 2.7% Short Line 2.65% New York Avenue 2.6% Water Works 2.54% Tennessee Avenue 2.47% Free Parking 2.45% Community Chest 2.44% Community Chest - 2 2.43% St. James Place 2.39% Electric Company 2.39% Kentucky Avenue 2.39% Chance 2.38% Chance - 2 2.35% Income Tax 2.35% Vermont Avenue 2.35% Pennsylvania Railroad 2.34% Indiana Avenue 2.33% Connecticut Avenue 2.3% Chance - 3 2.29% Oriental Avenue 2.29% B. \u0026amp; O.

Previously, I had attempted to model the metro of Paris, and then perform a shortest path search on two random stations within.\nThis time, I have chosen to target Montreal, and while I had initially wanted to perform greenspace analysis (due to my interest in the Ruelles Vertes), I had quickly found data for air pollution therein. This data looked pretty comprehensive to me (foreshadowing), so I figured that it would be interesting to consider air pollution across Montreal. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;d be able to use some of my osmnx knowledge to plot some information over it to possibly reveal more information.\nI used this dataset from Montreal government\u0026rsquo;s website providing data on the city itself (Montréal Données Ouvertes), which provided historical data on Montreal\u0026rsquo;s air pollution. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin by trying to understand this data.\naq = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;rsqa-indice-qualite-air-2019-2021.csv\u0026#39;) aq.head() stationId polluant valeur date heure 0 17 CO 1 2019-02-19 18 1 17 O3 20 2019-02-19 18 2 17 NO2 3 2019-02-19 18 3 17 PM 9 2019-02-19 18 4 80 SO2 1 2019-02-19 18 stationId refers to the id of the station in which the measurement was taken at.\npolluant refers to the pollutant the measure refers to.\nvaleur is the quantified amount of the pollutant. According to Montreal\u0026rsquo;s data page, the data ranges as follows:\n1-25 : Good 26-50 : Acceptable 50 \u003e : Bad date is the date the measurement was taken.\nheure is the hour the measurement was taken, in 24h.\nAt first, I was unaware of what the stationId exactly refers to. However, after look around Montréal Données Ouvertes a bit more, I managed to find another useful dataset that would explain this better:\nstations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations.head() numero_station SNPA statut nom adresse arrondissement_ville latitude longitude X Y secteur_id secteur_nom hauteur 0 1 50102 fermé Jardin Botanique Jardin Botanique, Montréal Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie 45.5622 -73.5718 299196 5.04692e+06 1 Centre-Ville 4 1 3 50103 ouvert Saint-Jean-Baptiste 1050 A, St-Jean-Baptiste Rivière-des-Prairies 45.641 -73.4997 304825 5.05568e+06 4 Est 4 2 6 50124 ouvert Anjou 7650 rue Châteauneuf Anjou 45.6028 -73.5589 300207 5.05144e+06 4 Est 12 This has been shortened further for the sake of length\nHere, we can see that the numero_station would relate to our stationId, and thus now we know it correlates to a particular station somewhere in Montreal where the data was obtained or calculated. So, for example, the station with stationId=17 was found to be Caserne 17 at 4240 rue Charleroi.\nNow that our data has been established and related, we need a way to project it onto an actual map of Montreal. In this case, I will be used geopandas and a shapefile of Montreal, which just outlines the shape of a geographic area that we can graph and project information onto:\nimport geopandas as gpd import pandas as pd from shapely.geometry import Point from matplotlib.colors import TwoSlopeNorm montreal_shape = gpd.read_file(\u0026#39;montreal_shapefile.geojson\u0026#39;) fig,ax = plt.subplots() montreal_shape.plot(ax=ax) stations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations_latlong = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(stations[\u0026#39;longitude\u0026#39;], stations[\u0026#39;latitude\u0026#39;])] montreal_stations_geo = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=stations_latlong) montreal_stations_geo.plot(ax=ax, markersize=20, color=\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) Projection of station locations onto Montreal\rUnfortunately, for some reason, projecting the locations of the stations onto the map itself seems to distort it a bit? We\u0026rsquo;ll deal with that in our final projection and display later.\nDoubly unfortunately, these stations are clustered in a particular subset of the arrondissements of Montreal. This means that we will not get at all a very fully defined graph, but one that will rather have information based upon a particular subset of the arrondissements. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have an idea of how to deal with this, so I\u0026rsquo;ll let it live, at least for now.\nOtherwise, the data is historic over a few years and over many days, so, we will first perform some aggregate computation on the amount of pollution per pollutant per station in the city:\naq = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;rsqa-indice-qualite-air-2019-2021.csv\u0026#39;) aq_stations = aq[\u0026#39;stationId\u0026#39;].unique() aq_poll_types = aq[\u0026#39;polluant\u0026#39;].unique() avg_res_lst = [] for t in aq_poll_types: avg_res = {} aq_t = aq[aq[\u0026#39;polluant\u0026#39;] == t] for s in aq_stations: all_val = aq_t[aq_t[\u0026#39;stationId\u0026#39;] == s] if len(all_val) \u0026gt; 0: avg_val = sum(all_val[\u0026#39;valeur\u0026#39;]) / len(all_val[\u0026#39;valeur\u0026#39;]) avg_res[s] = avg_val avg_res_lst.append(avg_res) stations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations = stations.set_index(\u0026#39;numero_station\u0026#39;) for i in range(0, len(aq_poll_types)): stations[aq_poll_types[i]] = avg_res_lst[i] stations.head() numero_station SNPA statut nom adresse arrondissement_ville latitude longitude X Y secteur_id secteur_nom hauteur CO O3 NO2 PM SO2 1 50102 fermé Jardin Botanique Jardin Botanique, Montréal Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie 45.5622 -73.5718 299196 5.04692e+06 1 Centre-Ville 4 nan nan nan nan nan 3 50103 ouvert Saint-Jean-Baptiste 1050 A, St-Jean-Baptiste Rivière-des-Prairies 45.641 -73.4997 304825 5.05568e+06 4 Est 4 nan 15.7134 2.27282 11.279 1.29435 6 50124 ouvert Anjou 7650 rue Châteauneuf Anjou 45.6028 -73.5589 300207 5.05144e+06 4 Est 12 nan 14.1824 2.89384 11.4153 0.992231 This table has been shortened for the sake of length\nHmm, I don\u0026rsquo;t like how a lot of the stations lack air pollution data.

The above code shows the example for just one of the plots, the rest follow the same methadology, just changing the particular pollutant.\nAir Pollution in Montreal by Pollutant Type\rYeah, a lot of unknown data there. Interestingly, pollution of PM (particular matter) appears to be the worst here, whereas the rest of the pollution isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad at all, at least as far as I can tell. Everything here appears to fall witin the 1-25 range anyhow, which is defined by the city of Montreal as the range for air pollution to be at a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; level.\nHmm, now we can consider the osmnx factor. Particularly, I want to see which areas in Montreal are zoned for industral landuse, and then project that onto the air pollution. First, let\u0026rsquo;s display the areas zoned for industrial use:\nmontreal = \u0026#34;Montreal, Quebec, Canada\u0026#34; area = ox.geocode_to_gdf(montreal) constr_tags = {\u0026#39;landuse\u0026#39;:[\u0026#39;industrial\u0026#39;]} parks = ox.features_from_place(montreal, constr_tags) fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6)) area.plot(ax=ax, facecolor=\u0026#39;white\u0026#39;, zorder=0) edges.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=0.5, edgecolor=\u0026#39;dimgrey\u0026#39;, zorder=1) parks.plot(ax=ax, color=\u0026#39;#fa7474\u0026#39;, alpha=0.7, markersize=10, zorder=3) plt.axis(\u0026#39;off\u0026#39;) Industrial Zoning in Montreal\rAnd now that we have that! We can just overlay the industrial zoning parts onto one of our geopandas graphs from earlier. In this case, I\u0026rsquo;ll just settle on the one that shows the particulate matter pollution as that was the most prevalent one:\nParticular Matter Air Pollution vs. Industrial Zoning in Montreal\rAnd there we are! We can see that there is a reasonable amount of areas zoned for industrial use in the city, and we can relate that to areas of air pollution. This would be a lot nicer if we had more rich data on the air pollution in the particular arrondissements of Montreal, but I think this is reasonable as a teaching tool, at least for me.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/bookreviews/murderontheorientexpress/","title":"Murder on the Orient Express","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rMurder on the Orient Express\r#\rAgatha Christie\r#\rNovember 27, 2021\n5/5\nThe interesting thing about my reading schedule lately has been that I have been alternating between classic novels and Christie novels.

I googled many of the locations listed so I could understand what they looked like as I read it, but I imagine that reading each poem in their listed location would be far more gratifying than reading it in bed, like I did.\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes Rome (or is currently in Rome, be it living there or just visiting), maybe they have never been or perhaps they just want to visit it on a night in at home, or to anybody who is interested in Roman history, and would like to go more into depth in the literary history of it.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/shortstories/realprogrammersusegmail/","title":"Real Programmers Use Gmail","section":"Short Stories","content":"\rReal Programmers Use Gmail\r#\rI was recently having a conversation with a good friend of mine from the university. We were both students of the computer, or Computer Science majors as most people knew us by. During this conversation, I happened upon a question then that did intrigue me greatly: “What do you use to code?”.\nSee, this programmer (along with many others at my school) happen to use the IDE (the meaning of which doesn’t matter, but I DuckDuckGoed it, and it means Integrated Development Environment if you really care) of Eclipse.\nNow, I understand that the use of Eclipse is quite common among many programmers, and so too are many other IDEs, like Microsoft Visual Studio and WebStorm. However, I simply cannot allow the glorious realm of Computer Science to continue to stray down such a dark and gloomy and sad and disgusting and distressing and disappointing and path.\nI believe that IDEs are the mark of an inferior programmer, and only true programmers would use a system like Gmail to complete their code. There are many other ways of coding that I do find acceptable, like YouTube comments to private videos published by yourself or even by writing the code directly onto unlined and ungridded Tomoe River Paper using a Mont Blanc fountain pen containing the ink of various goats sacrificed to Steve Zuckerberg, but Gmail is a far more accessible and more efficient tool.\nTo explain my use of Gmail, I find it helpful to go through how I code, starting from the beginning.\nI begin with a cup of coffee, black preferably (because black coffee, as it does provide a taste much like dirt, allows me to regain my sense of feeling as a programmer), before sitting down in my gamer chair preparing myself to code. I use a gamer chair, because it is the only chair that can handle the strong and strenuous movements of anger and frustration I make when coding. To match my chair I have a Logitech G PRO Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra Portable Tenkeyless Design, Detachable Micro USB Cable, 16.8 Million Color LIGHTSYNC RGB Backlit Keys (4.7 out of 5 stars, 1157 ratings), only the necessities.\nI then turn on my computer and enter “gmail.com” into the DuckDuckGo search bar. After providing my c\nredentials, I click on the compose button, but not after bragging to you (the reader), about my 17,345 unread emails (much of which is code previously created on Gmail). In the email construction box, I make sure that I put my own email address (GmailProgrammer4EVA2234@gmail.com) in the “To” section, to ensure that it goes to me, not to anybody else. In the subject line, I leave it blank, because I don’t have time to write out a subject line, I’m a busy programmer after all! After this, I generally find myself coffee-ed out, and so I take some of my caffeine pills (prescribed to me by me, not my doctor, because I don’t have the time to see doctors, I’m a busy programmer after all!) and pop about 5 pills into a bottle of water, and another 5 directly into my mouth, so as to chew them.\nThen I can finally begin to code, all within the text field, but sometimes, if I really feel like taking my programming prowess to the next level, I convert all of my paragraphs of code into one line and stick it in the subject field. This is a major feat within the world of computing, and so I make sure to additionally send an email with this subject line to my boss, with the additional message “Coming for your job next!!!1!11!1!”. When doing this, do make sure to consume as much caffeine as possible, as you don’t want to get tired whilst doing all that coding!\nAfter my work is done, I close my computer, before heading back to my kitchen to make another (well deserved) cup of black coffee.\nWhile it may seem like a lot of work, this is the true method of programming, and I hope that some of you lowly IDE programmers choose to enlighten yourselves and join me on this path.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/bookreviews/romeoandjulliet/","title":"Romeo and Julliet","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rRomeo and Julliet\r#\rWilliam Shakespeare\r#\rFebruary 19, 2022\n4/5\nGiven the many varying reviews of this novel that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen here, I was curious to see what I\u0026rsquo;d think of it after having finished reading the story.

The main downside I found in the book was the unbelievableness in some aspects of the story, like how excessively quickly Romeo and Juliet decided they loved each other, and things along those lines. I figured, after reading such things as that, that I would find the book unfavorable, mostly in how quickly an attempt was made to push the two together, but I found that Shakespeare did it fantastically and made the whole idea seem reasonable.\nMany facets of the book were absolutely lovely to read. Going in, I was sure that I would have trouble understanding what was going on, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad at all, the writing and speech do become rather melodic. The famous scenes of when Romeo first meets Juliet and when he speaks to her from her window were absolutely fantastic example of how nice the speech was to read. Their individual lines flowing from one character to another was done with such cleanliness that I genuinely felt the need to read it out loud, so as to get a better experience of the writing.\nI highly recommend this book to pretty much any reader.

Sometimes when looking at stock data, or when visualizing it, we may want to smooth out the data so that we can avoid shifted perceptions due to temporary changes in stock valuation. This may offer us a more comprehensive look at our data, that is not skewed by any minor blip.\nWe can change the duration of the rolling average, based upon how much smoothing we may want. For example, we could have a shorter smoothing of just 20 days, or longer smoothing of 100 days.\nBefore I did that, though, I first had to reindex my data. Because financial data is collected on weekdays, I had to account for that fact by adding in all of the non-included days in our data between the start and end dates we provided. We can fill these empty spots in with na and then we can reindex those to copy the previously entered piece of data into that box.\nimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt close = panel_data[\u0026#39;Close\u0026#39;] all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq=\u0026#39;B\u0026#39;) close = close.reindex(all_weekdays) close = close.fillna(method=\u0026#39;ffill\u0026#39;) short_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=20).mean() long_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=100).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() When developing a stock strategy, or trading strategy, we will want to analyze the change in the returns of our stock over time. One way to do this would be to look at relative returns. A relative return is the amount of return our stock will get after some timeline relative to some benchmark return. The formula for relative returns looks as follows.\n\\[\rr_{relative}(t) = \\frac{p(t) - p(t - 1)}{p(t - 1)}\r\\]\rAnother way to do this would be through logarithmic returns, the formula which is as follows.\n\\[\rr(t) = log(\\frac{p(t)}{p(t - 1)})\r\\]\rThere are many reasons why we may wish to use a log return, rather than relative returns, some of which would be that they capture the compounding effect. When we consider that financial investments such as these are compounded over many points in time, we may find this compounding important to capture in our data, which make log returns more appealing in their use.\nimport numpy as np log_returns = np.log(close).diff() fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(16, 12)) ax1.plot(log_returns.index, log_returns.cumsum(), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax1.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Cumulative log returns\u0026#39;) ax1.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax1.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) ax2.plot(log_returns.index, 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax2.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Total relative returns (%)\u0026#39;) ax2.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax2.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) plt.show() While analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively.

This method is evidently fairly easy to create, and shows us the general trend of our stock movement. Another method is known as the \u0026ldquo;exponential moving average\u0026rdquo; (EMA). This method of moving average places more importance/weight on more recent data points, so it accounts more strongly for recent changes in price.\nWith the EMA, we can also do it across a time period, perhaps 20 or even 100 days. Below I have graphed the regular stock price and both the EMA and SMA across 20 and 100 days, so as to easily see their differences.\nema_short = close.ewm(span = 20, adjust=False).mean() ema_long = close.ewm(span = 100, adjust=False).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(ema_short.index, ema_short, label=\u0026#34;20 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.plot(ema_long.index, ema_long, label=\u0026#34;100 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() Before making any investment it is critical to know the volatility of a stock, as it can give us insight into how risky the stock may be as an investment. Volatility measures how dispersed, or spread out, the returns for our stock is. Thus, the greater the volatility is, the riskier of an investment it would be. It can be calculated as the standard deviation between returns of the stock. Below you can see the measured stock volatility based upon the log returns of the stock price and its frequency.\nema_short = close.ewm(span = 20, adjust=False).mean() ema_long = close.ewm(span = 100, adjust=False).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(ema_short.index, ema_short, label=\u0026#34;20 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.plot(ema_long.index, ema_long, label=\u0026#34;100 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() There is a lot more analysis that can and should be done to better understand investments, in this case stock investments, so I intend to come back to this topic in the future to learn about more methods for financial analysis.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/bookreviews/stoner/","title":"Stoner","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rStoner\r#\rJohn Williams\r#\rJune 19, 2023\n5/5\nThis book was a rather quick read compared to what I\u0026rsquo;m used to.

One is a concierge named Renee, who does not wish for the rich people living in the building she works at to discover she has read a couple Dostoevskys and understands some Wikipedia articles on philosophy. She believes that she needs to present herself as ignorant and stupid, so that nobody inquires into her. This genuinely makes no sense to me (even when the reason for her actions are explained later in the book). I cannot comprehend how anybody would think that other people would care for the fact that you can read. No rich person gives two hoots of a whistle that you have read big books in the past, and the fact that the character genuinely believes that this information could ruin her life is ridiculous.\nThe other character is a young girl named Paloma, who lives in the same building and wants to kill herself and burn down the building. Fantastic. She is also supposedly quite smart and spends the entire book trying to find a meaning to live on. She also feels the need to hide her intelligence from her family (and her sister in particular), again for no reason really.\nI can understand that irritating characters don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a book bad, but these two people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any logical reasoning behind their actions, which frustrated me to no end throughout my reading.\nSecondly, there is a passage in the book that goes as follows:\n\u0026ldquo;When we Westerners walk, our culture dictates that we must, through the continuity of a movement we envision as smooth and seamless, try to restore what we take to be the very essence of life: efficiency without obstacles, a fluid performance that, being free of interruption, will represent the vital élan thanks to which all will be realized. For us the standard is the cheetah in action: all his movements fuse together harmoniously, one cannot be distinguished from the next, and the swift passage of the great wild animal seems like one long continuous movement symbolizing the deep perfection of life. When a J apanese woman disrupts the powerful sequence of natural movement with her jerky little steps, we ought to experience the disquiet that troubles our soul whenever nature is violated in this way, but in fact we are filled with a unfamiliar blissfulness, as if disruption could lead to a sort of ecstasy, and a grain of sand to beauty. What we discover in this affront to the sacred rhythm of life, this defiant movement of little feet, this excellence born of constraint, is a paradigm of Art.\u0026rdquo;\nNow a lot of this book touches on psychology and philosophy, things that I find interesting, but really don\u0026rsquo;t understand or have any fundamental knowledge in. But this passage did tread on some knowledge that I do have, walking (as it feels adjacent to flaneur). Given that, this entire passage made genuinely no sense to me, and did not logically connect.\nFirstly, the passage begins by attacking the western mode of walking, apparently we all walk \u0026ldquo;smooth and seamless\u0026rdquo;, because we all want to be efficient and fast. That is patently ridiculous. The flaneur (the very antithesis to this form of walking attributed to westerners) was born in the west, and in Paris for that matter! The very city this book takes place in. Also this is conflating all westerners together. You can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that someone from Waco, Texas walks the same as someone from New York City or someone from London.\nWhile this seems like something really stupid to complain about, this very discussion of walking appears to me to be a way that the author wants to critique western life (or modern western life), in that through our mode of walking, one can determine that we are all people that want efficiency, smoothness, and speed in our lives. This is, of course, false. Barbery appears to imagine that all westerners work at places like Wall Street and continuously name drop \u0026ldquo;the grindset\u0026rdquo; whilst chugging a Starbucks latte.\nThis form of walking is then juxtaposed with the Japanese form, which she describes as \u0026ldquo;jerky\u0026rdquo;, and is thus an \u0026ldquo;affront to the sacred rhythm of life\u0026rdquo;, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t smooth or fast. That also sounds absurd and over generalizes Japan the same way it did with the west previously. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that businessmen in Tokyo may fit the author\u0026rsquo;s previous complaint on western walking, while someone in a smaller town would not. This phase of the passage was also incredibly uncomfortable to read, at least for me.\nThis may not seem like a lot, and perhaps I am making a mountain out of a mole hill, but what it revealed to me is that on a single passage in which I had some very minimal knowledge on the background discussion, I could notice countless flaws that made the passage make no sense to me. That made me wonder how many more errors of this kind were present in the mass bulk of the novel, especially in areas I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand? Probably a lot, and reading some of the other reviews, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be too far off in that thought.\nOverall, this book was not very good.

Unlike \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo;, which quite often jumped back and forth in time and between stories of families, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; went through each time period chapter by chapter, causing a more fluid story in some sense. One other interesting difference was how \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo; appeared to have a primary story/timeline one followed (late 1800s to the early 1900s), however, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; does not have this. Each time period is important and engaging in its own way, and each former time period would be recalled and regaled in later chapters in some way.\nThe one common downside of Edward Rutherford books is that there are very often phases of the story that feel incredibly clunky, which is in part due to the massive amounts of factual information being provided. If I recall correctly, in the first chapter, there was a few page long discussion of trees in the New Forest, and while it was certainly interesting, it felt a little bit out of place compared to the story that was just taking place. In this sense, the fact delivery nature of the novels can be clunky, but really I\u0026rsquo;ve read no other author\u0026rsquo;s work that can handle it very smoothly. In some sense, it feels like a hazard of the trade.\nEach chapter was very engaging and fun, and I often felt sad at leaving the characters I had finally grown accustomed to in the last chapter to sally forth and read about their descendants. I highly recommend this book both for its story and its historical delivery.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/bookreviews/the_grip_of_film/","title":"The Grip of Film","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Grip of Film\r#\rRichard Aoyade\r#\rOctober 2, 2023\n4/5\nThis is a pretty good book.

As the book went on though, I found the jokes to be gradually less funny, but I think that is partly due to the fact that the entire book is effectively full of jokes all of the same type and style. Some may really love this, but others may find it more tedious.\nIn this way, I gradually just started looking forward to the end of the novel, but I still think it was worthwhile, and definitely a pretty good book.\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/bookreviews/the_learners/","title":"The Learners","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Learners\r#\rChip Kidd\r#\rJanuary 1, 2024\n5/5\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t actually heard of Chip Kidd until I started reading this book, and for some strange reason, I began this book thinking it was an autobiography. This book I have a bit of trouble explaining, it shows, in some sense, the use and importance of graphic design in our world, and there are some fantastic spreads and gags in the book related to it. In another sense, though, this book questions the innate sense of or sentiment of humanity, at our core selves.\nThe pivot that occurs in this book, and the direction it began to take, I think was perfectly pointed in this book and came just at the right time.

I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I more so consider it to be a mystery or comedy, but it is certainly a bit of both. There were moments reading it where I genuinely laughed out loud, and that hardly happens to me with books, so that was a lovely surprise. This book is a bit more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I\u0026rsquo;ve read, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably due to the subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.\nThere were a few gripes I do have with the novel, two in fact. Firstly, a lot of the intrigue happens a bit late in the book, so I found myself reading somewhat slowly for the first two thirds of the book, and the speeding it and the last mark. This is, of course, expected (especially for a mystery novel), but I felt the balance was a bit skewed. This hardly impacted my enjoyment of the novel though. Secondly, there were a lot of moments were you could mistake our septuagenarians for being more middle aged, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bothered by this either.\nOverall this was a fantastic and fun read, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend you read it if you want to try something a little lighthearted, and funny all the same!\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/bookreviews/the_martian_chronicles/","title":"The Martian Chronicles","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Martian Chronicles\r#\rRay Bradbury\r#\rJuly 23, 2023\n5/5\nPotential spoilers ahead.\nI went into this book thinking that it would have a linear storyline, but found that not to be the case.

I think that the nature of this book being a collection of short stories about humans on Mars was incredible, and I feel like it gave me a way as to be able to see how humans would act, and not just one tribe of humans.\nThis is an incredible novel, and I feel like much of what it has to say about humanity remains true to this day.

The first half took a good few weeks, but the second half was finished rather quickly.\nI recall reading something in the preface/note that mentioned that Henchard was not a bad man, but that he is hot-tempered. It was hard, for much of the novel, for me to understand why that statement was true, why it was the case, but I seemed to then have forgotten something I recall now, that people can change. This novel is the greatest example of the complexity of humans that I have thus far read. This book is very effective in showing that we are not 1 dimensional beings with a set of non-malleable characteristics.\nThe full title of this novel, \u0026ldquo;The Mayor of Casterbridge: A Story of a Man of Character\u0026rdquo;, really fits the theme of the story. What does it mean \u0026ldquo;to have character\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;ve done some quick Googling, but have gotten many different answers: moral excellence and firmness or being able to deal well with difficult situations. However, the best definitions, to me at least, discuss individuality, and how \u0026ldquo;character\u0026rdquo; just means the sum of our traits. This means that you can have good character or bad character, they can all fall under the same label, at least I suppose so (I\u0026rsquo;m not a linguist, nor am I good at English).\nTo describe Henchard as a \u0026ldquo;man of character\u0026rdquo; is fitting to me, though with the definition I have given, it fits all of us wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it? I like how ambiguous this phrase is, though. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell us much, then, about Henchard, but effectively that he is just a person, like any of us. In that way, I guess we can all perhaps see at least some of ourselves in Henchard (or maybe I just have problems that need to be resolved).\nForgive me for these poorly written ramblings. I have no qualifications in reading or writing, I just enjoy thinking about it.\nThe book is fantastic, and if you want to read a story with characters that are just as complex, confusing, and contrary to their own nature as real people are, then I would give this novel a read.

Firstly I will note that quite often there are references to \u0026ldquo;little Russia\u0026rdquo;, of which I will ignore the political consequences in this r. They are rather big consequences, and they are interesting considerations. I actually learned of Nikolai Gogol first through those consequences, through an article by the New Yorker.\nThe stories themselves were very charming otherwise, and often very humorous.

The first story too, \u0026ldquo;Old Fashioned Farmers\u0026rdquo;, was a very pleasant read.\nI do recommend that these stories may be read, more so for pleasure and enjoyment, so long as you are able and willing to ignore certain choice wording.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/bookreviews/theshadowofthewind/","title":"The Shadow of the Wind","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Shadow of the Wind\r#\rCarlos Ruiz Zafón\r#\rJanuary 4, 2022\n4/5\nI found this book far easier to read than many of the previous books I\u0026rsquo;d finished. That does not necessarily make it any better, but it is something to be noted. Mostly that I have spent most of my time recently reading classics and mystery novels, so a historical fiction novel (which is interest-wise down my alley) would have likely been a different read to begin with.\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. It was a fantastic story that captured me for its duration. I read it quicker that most other books and could not put it down at many intervals. The story is that of a mystery in my mind, which could explain my enjoyment of it. But it does also wonderfully employ its characters to plot progression and does develop them to good effect throughout the book. It was moving and I can certainly recommend that anybody pick it up. If none of that made sense, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to forgive me - I am not great at reviewing books (if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear enough).\nWarning - some slight spoilers in the next paragraph.\nThe book does have some faults though. Without giving too much spoilers away, some things occurred throughout the novel and some characters became important rather suddenly. Which is fine, but does rather catch you off guard when comparing it to the rest of the story.\nOverall, this was a fun read and while I did not get much personally out of the book (at least as of this reading), I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody looking for an escapist novel or an overall fun and enjoyable novel.\n"},{"id":35,"href":"/bookreviews/utopia/","title":"Utopia","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rUtopia\r#\rThomas More\r#\rJune 14, 2022\n4/5\nUtopia is a satirical novel on English politics of the time period, at least I reckon.

However, this novel certainly is still very impactful, relevant, and important regardless of whether one can or can\u0026rsquo;t experience the satirical elements throughout.\nI would recommend that one read this book, I found it quite good, and it really is a fascinating read, experiencing another\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint of the world. Asking a person, especially one so educated as Sir Thomas Moore, about what they would see a perfect world to be down to the distribution of food, is interesting, and can paint a great image of the world that the author lived in at the time.\nBased on that, I think that anybody who wants to learn more about politics (the history of politics in particular I\u0026rsquo;d guess) may find this book quite interesting.\nThanks for reading!\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/bookreviews/victory/","title":"Victory","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rVictory\r#\rJoseph Conrad\r#\rDecember 21, 2022\n3/5\nThis book took me a long time to read, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t its fault, though, more of mine.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say the book was pretty good, albeit a little bit slow for my tastes throughout much of the beginning and middle of the book.\nThe ending was absolutely fantastic and when a lot of the writing really came through and shone for me.\nThe setting and description of place that highlighted certain scenes and acts in the story were done fantastically, and did help me lose myself in the plot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, I reckon I should read it again sometime in the future.\n"},{"id":37,"href":"/docs/aboutme/","title":"About Me","section":"Docs","content":"Hello, my name is Arsh Siddiqui.\nThis website contains a portfolio of my writing.\nHopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it\u0026hellip;\nThanks for coming along!\n"},{"id":38,"href":"/blog/","title":"Blog","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rBlog\r#\rMy thoughts on the most random and unconnected of things.\n2023\r#\rThis Latter Interest\nSelf Perception in Fashion: Why Dress?\nThe Dangers of a Hyper-Niche Base\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/bookreviews/","title":"Book Reviews","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rBook Reviews\r#\rAll of my book reviews, these are adapted from my Goodreads.

I discovered osmnx through this and later, through Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s Blog, became extremely excited at the idea.\nSo I figured I may as well give it a go. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done or worked on many personal projects in a while so this did excite me quite a lot.\nFirstly, I had to choose a city and an idea that I\u0026rsquo;d model out. Something pretty basic to start with in my mind would be modeling a city itself, and then perhaps do some kind of shortest path earch on the metro overlayed upon the city.\nBecause I have an immense bias to everything French, I immediately chose to do Paris.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to first pull up a city and model it through a network with osmnx:\nG = ox.graph_from_place(\u0026#34;Paris, France\u0026#34;) ox.plot_graph(G) Our first model of Paris\rThe data we recieve here is all modeled with networkx, so it is, in effect, a modeling of nodes and edges. In this case, I believe we are modeling the streets/roads of Paris and the connections between them. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of how this looks, so let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and change it up a bit.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by taking a look at our data itself, and how it\u0026rsquo;s structured:\ngdf_nodes, gdf_edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G) gdf_nodes.head() Description of our data\rWe can take this data and just restructure it and redesign its output and thus its appearance:\nG2 = ox.graph_from_gdfs(gdf_nodes, gdf_edges, graph_attrs=G.graph) ox.plot_graph(G2, node_size=0, bgcolor=\u0026#34;#ffffff\u0026#34;, node_color=\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;) Redesigned model of Paris\rAlright, now that we have a somewhat decent model of Paris up, we can now consider their metro system. We can do this by performing a filter on the data that we get from osmnx where we look in particular for railways and subways ([\u0026quot;railway\u0026quot;~\u0026quot;subway\u0026quot;]).\nG3 = ox.graph_from_place(\u0026#34;Paris, France\u0026#34;, retain_all=False, truncate_by_edge=True, simplify=True, custom_filter=\u0026#39;[\u0026#34;railway\u0026#34;~\u0026#34;subway\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;) ox.plot_graph(G3) Model of Paris's Metro\rAlright! So that looks about right. The design isn\u0026rsquo;t fantastic, but we can fix that, or we can make it look even more ridiculous! Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and pull out all of the information from this metro data and overlay it onto the city data we got from earlier.

Quite often the things for which demand is being generated for are not necessities.

Speaking for myself, I definitely (attempt to) tailor how I appear depending on who I am meeting (or expect to meet) and where I am. Surely then, I would like to have full control over how I appear and all decisions related to that.\nAnd like every sane fashion enthusiast, I continue to disregard the weather when making stylisic decisions. I will absolutely wear sweaters in 80 degree weather.\nOur clothes, then, should be an extension of ourselves. It should enhance our perceptions of ourselves, or how we desire to perceive ourselves, and should accurately signify that image to others. There are always going to be communication issues, of course, in that certain signifiers that may clearly indicate one thing to us could indicate something else to someone else (imagine improperly encoded unicode characters leading to incorrectly translated messages between two phones or how black can mean mourning in one culture and something totally different in another culture). This issue of communication, however, isn\u0026rsquo;t something we need be bogged down in, because another more interesting question arises therein, namely are we truly identifying ourselves through our clothing?\nDo you see someone dressed up for work or something casual?\rFor one, the vast majority of us do not make our own clothes, we seek out clothes that we like and that possibly relate to us in some way or another. These clothes each have a message correlated with them, either literally (with printed textual shirts - which can just directly display a message), or through social ques (like a winchester shirt, which one can connote to banking). It is interesting, then, to consider that we are seeking to develop (or enhance) meaning for ourselves through things that were not created by us, but for us. And those designers can very well have very different imaginings and/or significances they themselves imbue into the pieces they create. The finance guy that wishes to be perceived as a finance guy will purchase the blue oxford collar button down, brown chinos, and grey patagonia vest, because they wish to be seen as part of \u0026ldquo;the tribe\u0026rdquo;, yet that vest they wear was designed and sold by a company that very much so supports environmentalism and slow consumption (at least at face value, this ladder concern is a wholly new issue unto itself), the opposite of a money driven and imbued career.\nWinchester shirt correlates with baking. This is also an example how I wanted to dress when I was in high school\rSo in one way it is strange that we take clothes designed by others and purport our own meaning unto them, where our meaning can overshadow the original intention. However, that example of the finance guy (and even the examples before) are of a very mainstream perception. If I was to, for instance, discuss consumers of Yohji Yamamoto or Rick Owens, we would be reaching into a very different, but interesting territory.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll preface this by saying that I personally can not consider myself an expert or even somewhat knowledgeable on fashion, and especially fashion of the variance that I will proceed to talk about. In this way, a lot of what I perceive and discuss will likely be from a very abstracted angle.\nFrom what I have been able to observe of fans of designers like these (Yamamoto and Owens), I can see that they use clothing to paint a picture of themselves to a much stronger degree than the vast majority of us do. For instance, right now I\u0026rsquo;m wearing a grey puppytooth polo tucked into some salt and pepper trousers. This does portray an image (even moreso because I\u0026rsquo;m writing this while sitting at a cafe), but it isn\u0026rsquo;t as strong as say how the \u0026ldquo;Rick enthusiast\u0026rdquo; works with their clothes. Their outfits are very self descriptive, and you can see a lot of a person in them.\nYohji Yamamoto Fall/Winter 2022. This is also an example of how I wanted to dress in sophomore year of university.\rI\u0026rsquo;m going to move away from those two designers, because I do not know enough to speak about them. However, what I have mentioned about them is applicable to many different designers, and designers of many different generations and times. Consider Yves Saint Laurent: what sort of image do you have of a woman that wears YSL? I\u0026rsquo;ll speak of the mid to late 1960s, when he debuted \u0026ldquo;le smoking\u0026rdquo; jacket, so that I can capture a particular image. To me, the kind of woman who would wear Saint Laurent of that time was somebody who was elegant, sophisticated, cool, and ambiguous: the kind of person who would chainsmoke outside a parisian opera, and look mysterious and seductive while doing so. These kinds of designers have such a strong image of perception attached to their clothing that even the whisper of their name can paint an imaginative wonderland into the minds of those even vaguely aware.\n\"Le smoking\" jacket. Also an example of how I want to dress now.\rThe image I described in the above paragraph is effectively this image, but that was kind of the purpose of this exercise. The image itself has such a social cachet that my imagination of the \"YSL woman\" defaults to this woman whom I don't know.\nYet, how can one\u0026rsquo;s personal style be defined in such a way? What I have just described doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily sound personal does it? Some among us might say that what designers and brands are really doing is selling an image to consumers who are gullible enough to want to pursue that image (generated demand - feeling as though you need to be perceived in such a way, and can only do that by purchasing and wearing clothes made by X designer). Indeed, in some respects a good designer is able to create and attach characteristics to their clothing; they are able to create an imaginary person who would be the \u0026ldquo;wearer\u0026rdquo; of their clothes, an imaginary person who you could become and inhabit with the right amount of money.\nThink back to the woman who would wear the YSL smoking jacket. What does she do in her free time? What kind of person is she? What kinds of conversations would she have? What would she read/watch/listen to? Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be like this fictitious woman, but there are many who do, and Saint Laurent was able to create an image of a woman that many did (and still do) aspire to.\nBut to the consumers of these designers: they genuinely feel like they can see themselves in those clothes. What right do I have to tell them that they\u0026rsquo;re just endlessly pursuing an effigy crafted and commodified by a designer? If it is meaningful to them, why not let them vivre leur vie? And yet, generated demand still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It still feels that the idea of designers making a pipeline towards an idea that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, a road paved with lots of clothing bills, is not necessarily an honest way of designing clothes. But still, that is their job! Good designers are able to create those imaginary worlds and figures, and the pieces that were best able to achieve that became pieces of history - clothing you can see at the Met! But to paint myself with ideas and emotions crafted by others feels dishonest in some weird way.\nI think it feels dishonest to me because, with clothes like those, I can easily manipulate my self perception to others, depending on what I want. Almost as though I always have a mask affixed that can present me in any way I want. There still persists that common addage that clothes are a person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;armor to get them through the day\u0026rdquo; anyhow. In this view, it becomes an extension of my inability to tell anybody else who I am really, or to let them see that.\nMaybe this is just a me problem...\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really know, though. These are just my two cents on the idea of individuality or personal perception through fashion. Really, as with most things, it is probably just related to how we as beings act socially, and with what we personally seek out in social relationships. Those mesh with how we dress ourselves, and thus any and all of our desires therein can be harnessed by designers and brands to make lots of money.\n"},{"id":47,"href":"/shortstories/","title":"Short Stories","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rShort Stories\r#\rStories that I have written of a reasonably short nature.

For one, the story of the man himself is interesting and enjoyable in it of itself. And then additionally the mathematical presentation and the concepts therein are additionally quite fascinating.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re More Ghosts Than People\nThis provides an interesting juxtaposition between the playing of a video game and the life of the narrator, particularly with respect to the attempt to redeem oneself.\nThe Forgotten End of the Second World War\nThis is incredibly fascinating. I should begin by stating that the information presented in this article should be known and taught to students in America, unfortunately, it often isn\u0026rsquo;t. This discusses, in brief, some information about the Pacific theatre of the war, and some details that are quite critical to the development of modern society since then, that should be known by much more Americans.\nThe End of the English Major\nA lot was discussed in this article - a lot that I want to explore, think about, and write about. Generally it deals with humanitites majors today and the shifts they are facing. These shifts are related to both society\u0026rsquo;s view of them, their ability to adapt to changing interests (and desires), and some thought about its future. In particular with this last point, there was some thought going to the idea that the humanities could be the future, which is something I really want to write about.\nGiving Bambi the Boot\nMore information about deer, their societal view, and the danger they pose to certain environments that I could have ever asked for. Also, one of the few articles I have been able to view on a website with almost no bloat.\nHow to Keep a Great Magazine Going\nThis discusses the history of a magazine I had not known much about that has recently celebrated its 50th year. Given all the struggles journalism, news reporting, and magazines have gone through in this digital age, reading about a magazine trying to eke out a world within it, and seeing it survive, is lovely.\nRereading Russian Classics in the Shadow of the Ukraine War\nJust a lot of interesting and thought provoking discussion about Russia\u0026rsquo;s historical relationship with Ukraine through the lens of Russian literature. I think this article gives a lot of explanation towards Ukranians views towards certain authors (Alexander Pushkin in particular). It also sets up the reading of certain authors in a light I would not have considered (like Nikolai Gogol\u0026rsquo;s The Nose).\nWhat We Search For\nBoth an article about the long and ongoing search for a missing person in California\u0026rsquo;s Eastern Sierra and a story about coming to terms with loss.

Cult-like followings of certain brands or aesthetics have become more popular than ever, and now brands have seen, or will see, a need to attract these consumers to survive. Attracting this consumer base is no doubt of great importance for the survival of brands, particularly those that are smaller or are still growing.\nRather than traditional larger subsets of fashion subcultures, there are presently a large amount of small subgroups of people eking out a sizeable portion of the general genre of style. Consider the large amount of fashion magazines with their small, but loyal audiences. Magazines like Purple, Self-Service, or even The Gentlewoman are all fairly unique, small magazines that all have small audiences (in fact, there is even a novel published by Ane Lynge-Jorlen that recognizes the achievements of these niche fashion magazines: \u0026ldquo;Niche Fashion Magazines: Changing the Shape of Fashion\u0026rdquo;).\nPrevious copies of The Gentlewoman\rOne doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have to look towards the prevalence of niche magazines to see the growth of subcultures, reddit and other social media services, for instance, can be used to find more and more cultures for the most specific of styles and manners. In this sense, it can feel like while the popularity of any one style or aesthetic may not be particularly large, the quantity of aesthetics with a decent following has increased (one can go through the bowels of the aesthetics wikia to get an idea). This quantity has lead to extremely non-mainstream styles like menocore (Nancy Meyers/Eileen Fisher/etc.) and zizmorcore (New York kitsch) to develop followings on places like TikTok.\nExample of zizmorcore\rIt seems reasonable, then, for brands to target these small subcultures as a way to maintain relevance. In fact, some brands may even feel that they could survive with a small, but loyal fanbase. There are assuredly many brands that have done so successfully, however I believe this to be a rather risky move.\nFor one, fanbases are fickle. This is especially the case in the world of fashion. They don\u0026rsquo;t last forever and their followers cannot be trusted for sustained activity. Anybody that\u0026rsquo;s spent more than a month on TikTok or has heard of microtrends would know this to be the case. Nobody dresses up as pirates or wenches or sings shanties as much as they did that one week in June 2020 (external to the age of seafaring of course).\nOf course, only companies with large range, like Shein, were able to target these trends, but how can you tell beforehand if a trend will be sustained or it will die within a week? My guess is that if you were a smaller company and thought seafaring pirates would be the theme of the decade and put a lot of development into it, you would have collapsed quickly.\nAdditionally, brands that start small, by targeting a specific aesthetic or style, will always have the option to go large and target more styles, perhaps more general styles. This is what happened to the Banana Republic, which started with what most might consider to be a safari (or safari inspired) style. While today they may be paying homage to their birthright, they\u0026rsquo;ve stuck with a pretty simple \u0026ldquo;business-friendly\u0026rdquo; style for quite a long time.\nBanana Republic\u0026rsquo;s heritage of \u0026ldquo;the safari\u0026rdquo; is prety colonialist isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nI mean this image is just inches away from a group of white people strutting around some colonial clubhouse in an African or Asian town in white linen suits, though I suppse that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too surprising given the naming convention.\nThese companies will also have to continuously ask themselves if they could become more profitable by switching their lanes. Consider, if you will, a boardwalk on a beach. If there is one person selling soda on the boardwalk, they should position themselves towards the center, so that they are at a vantage point towards all consumers.\nWhat if two people were selling soda on the boardwalk?\nThey would cannibalize each others\u0026rsquo; sales by staying near each other, so they would each be at two ends of the boardwalk.\nIf a third person comes along, they would likely situate themselves an equal distance from each company so as to be approachable from the most people.\nThis is all only true if each company were angels and did not want to cannibalize others\u0026rsquo; sales.\nConsider that if there were two sellers on the boardwalk, one of the sellers could keep moving towards the other side and poach more and more of the other sellers\u0026rsquo; consumers without losing their own. As the quantity of sellers increases, this will become more of an issue.\nThis metaphor is applicable to many different scenarios and circumstances (why do all radio stations play the same music?), but I feel that it has a particular relation to that of the stylistic choices that any one brand can choose to make, at least in the theoretical platonic ideal world. The real world is messy, of course, with issues like brand legacy and company size playing a key role in the relevance of the above metaphor. Yet, considering the world that smaller brands or newer brands are birthed into, and given that in order for them to be able to market themselves towards an audience successfully, they have to make styling decisions that would make them worth your attention, I think it is a fair comparision.\nThis is why more general fashion brands succeed, and why it is easy for small fashion labels aiming at a niche style to fail (at least theoretically). They can easily grow a larger audience by also targeting some other style. Or, a larger label could poach their sales by also selling something in the target style. This ladder issue could easily kill a small company, even if it wanted to remain true to its aesthetic.\nThese concerns will hang like daggers over the proverbial head of the company at all times. Becoming successful in ones\u0026rsquo; aesthetic lane takes a lot more than just correctly targeting a fanbase, but would require a lot of luck that nobody will encroach on your (limited) consumer base, and would require you to ignore profits to produce a single style. The deck is stacked against you.\n"},{"id":52,"href":"/blog/this_latter_interest/","title":"This Latter Interest","section":"Blog","content":"\rThis Latter Interest\r#\rAugust 5, 2023\nIt often comes to me that I worry about what major decisions I have made for myself in the past that I really have little power to change. The most prominent perhaps of these was my decision to pursue Computer Science. I did, indeed, used to enjoy technology when I was a younger fellow, but as time passed, I had teachers and professors that consistently, compounded, pulled me towards the arts. Whether that was in relation to history, fashion, or, most prominently, writing. This latter interest is a curious one. For my chosen field, my writing ability is a bit of an anomaly. This is not to say that it is any good – you who have read my other work (to the nameless reader who, if all is well, does not and should not know who I am, but in all likelihood is one of less than a biscuit tin of people aware of my nebulous and ill-formed thoughts – and to you if that is you: thank you for knowing me!) would certainly be able to agree with me on this – but that it is of an, at least, minutely improved ability over my technological peers (of which you have likely realized is due to my overly flowery language that seeks to dazzle, but not to mean or explain). To make up for this, however, I am granted a significant lack in ability in my chosen field. I am, by no means, an absolute wretch at the subject, but I am, especially when in the minute gatherings of the few that for some God knows reason have chosen to be aware of me to a greater level than I myself am comfortable with (I provide the sound feeling of discomfort to myself on many a weekend night), not good enough. This is compounded with the people that I know, of greater skill levels in this field at this age than I may be able to ever achieve in anything ever. The numbers of these people and their grandeur in the subject appears to me to be increasing continuously. I don’t know if its something about me that ends up in their company, or if it’s simply…something else. I am fine at this subject, I know that, but clearly I am not in the right frame of mind to be in this subject. I wasn’t necessarily forced into it, I chose it of my own accord, but really I chose it for realism, or because it was within the scope of what others called realism (their scope included one other field). Am I interested in it? Probably, I do still on occasion find interesting things, and I am averted towards things I find interesting by those I know, but I don’t feel any need to learn it, beyond just what I need to survive whatever number of years at a job. The other interests I find much more intelligible, and I find myself relishing their presence more than ever as the time passes and as my conaissance with the impressives continues. And thus I have my latter interest, which compels me to be myself – lazy, indecisive, apologetic, confusing without reason, wanting to please – and sell that, if I want it to be present, or really if I want it to exist and to outlast me. I want to know that what I am writing is meaningful or at least is graced and affirmed by the eyes of someone who understands or appreciates. So I want the output of that latter interest to be good, but I can’t forget who I am; I also want to be over with it – to have sent it out there and to not see it again in my inbox. And I don’t want to have to hold it high above my head in the crowd of others and recite it to an audience to be accepted into their community as one from the beginning, and not a confused little rabbit seeing carrots in multiple directions thinking he can only move in one. I’m not sure if I want to end up the Sancho Panza realist and continue through my chosen field and discover (as Don Quixote never does) that life is dull and dreary, and filled with people ready to find humor (and especially monetary value) in your strong delusional belief to the contrary. I want to send out my work, hold it lightly in hand, and deliver it to someone who finds it interesting, and can parlay it to the world. Instead, I see my own work in my inbox, as many others do. I want to know that I can make you feel, that I can help you find meaning, or that I can help you yell inside the depths of your mind what you didn’t know how to phrase but knew so dearly and so desperately to be true. That you are alone and that the only way you think you can somehow help people or find meaning in your own life or find some people to be in good humor with is by creating things. But you know that those things are quite frankly not very good, and that you aren’t sure ever will be good. And even with all that, you don’t know if you want your work to be found, if you want it to be meaningful to some people, or if you just don’t want to be forgotten and you just want the people around you, sparse though they may be, to love you (and by God it is even hard to type those four letters), if not just find you to be an agreeable person.\n"}]
