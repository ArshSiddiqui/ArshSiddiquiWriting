# **Other Websites**

These are some of my older websites that showcase other projects of mine. They're all effectively
poorly executed jokes.  

[Multiple Deprivation in London](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/CityModeling/Cities/London/multiple%20deprivation/MultipleDeprivationLondon.html)  
Showcase multiple deprivation, a measure of poverty, across the different wards of London.

[NYC Buildings v. Heights](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/CityModeling/Cities/New%20York/CityModel/NewYorkModel.html)  
Basic geospatial project, showcasing New York City modeled with building heights.

[Humourous Marketplace](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/HumourousMarketplace/)  
Made for a hackathon, and I was tired.

[Limbousine](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/limbousine/)   
Takes you to the nearest middle of nowhere from your current location.

[The Sun Never Sets on the American Military Base](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/TheSunNeverSetsOnTheAmericanMilitaryBase/)  
List all of the current American military bases currently under daylight.

[The Onion or Not](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/TheOnionOrNot/)  
Can you guess which articles are satire and which aren't?

[Are They Breakdancing or Are They Falling Over?](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/BreakdancingOrFallingOver/)  
As the title suggests.

[Minimalistism](https://arshsiddiqui.github.io/Minimalistism/)  
Do you really need that?
