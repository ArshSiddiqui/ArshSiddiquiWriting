# The Grip of Film

#### Richard Aoyade 

*October 2, 2023*  

4/5

This is a pretty good book. It is quite funny, and I did genuinely find myself laughing out loud more than I would have expected going into the book. In that sense, it is quite agreable. As the book went on though, I found the jokes to be gradually less funny, but I think that is partly due to the fact that the entire book is effectively full of jokes all of the same type and style. Some may really love this, but others may find it more tedious.  

In this way, I gradually just started looking forward to the end of the novel, but I still think it was worthwhile, and definitely a pretty good book.
