# Death of a Salesman

#### Arthur Miller

*March 14, 2022*  

5/5  

I've read only one of Miller's books in the past, The Crucible, which was, of course, a fantastic novel. 
I'd heard of this book around the time I was reading that and it was described as one of the best American 
plays. I've finally gotten around to reading it and I can certainly agree with that claim.  

I think that a lot of us, or at least me, spend a lot of time and hope that we will go on to be successful 
in some way or another in our lives, and we put a lot of thought into it. I try to convince myself that it's 
both hard to measure success and it's hard to be successful, but it's hard for me to rewire my brain like that.  

This novel certainly echoes a lot of the inner monologue I had going on for a while, and it was both comforting 
and terrifying to read about it in the novel. The novel describes the story of one man's life, his trials and 
tribulations, and his frustrations all in one day. Reading it all out like that certainly gave me a lot to 
think about my life, and what I saw for myself in the future. Though, to be frank, I don't really know what 
to think about my life or existence.  

The book is a great read, and it is a fantastic description of a human life in the modern day. I would 
recommend that one read this book.
