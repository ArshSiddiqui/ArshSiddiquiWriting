5/5  

This book was a rather quick read compared to what I'm used to. It as, as simply as can be said, the story of the life of a man, which by its very nature does not necessarily sound interesting, but I think that the simplicity and eternal relevance of the subject matter make it so captivating.  

This is very likely one of the best books I've read this year thus far, and it has made me think about myself more than any other book has.  

The quality of the writing, and the nature of life's progression make this book an immense experience.  

I highly recommend it.
