# An Unsuitable Job for a Woman

#### P.D. James

*August 15, 2024*

5/5

This is a really good novel. I really really do love this, and I don't quite know why. I also read this book for a course in detective fiction, but I recall having quite fond memories of the time in which I had read it, I think an unseasonably warm Autumn.  

Part of that like I think had to deal with the immaculate descriptions of the environment the novel takes place in, being Cambridge. The novel really makes it feel like such a real and warm place, hightening a contrast with the "detective" aspects itself.  

The story itself is excellent, and the unraveling of the tale comes very cleanly and nicely. It's really good.  

Read it!
