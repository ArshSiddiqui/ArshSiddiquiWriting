# Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories, Volume I  

#### Arthur Conan Doyle  

*June 10, 2023*  

5/5  

It has taken me quite a while to actually read the full book. I've read many Holmes short stories, but I think the order of presentation, while not totally necessary, is pleasant.  

Of course, there is not much I can say about Holmes that has not already been said.  

I can only say that the stories and questions established by Doyle are certainly incredible, and leave the reader with a feeling of surprising clarity.  

Holmsian deduction when explained reveals itself to be rather simple, it is all logic and having a keen eye.  

I highly recommend Holmes of course, but I'd also suggest reading it in publication order, for that does provide some extra interest in some of Watsons notes preceding the bulk of each story.
