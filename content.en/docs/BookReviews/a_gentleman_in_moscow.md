# A Gentleman in Moscow

5/5  

The first time I had read this book, it was under the recommendation of a number of people I had respected, particularly my English teacher at the time. I had taken quite a long time to read it then, but the book really hit me at that time. Reading it again, it's probably actually hit me harder this time, but I feel like I read it too quickly, even though I still took like a month. I wanted to read it again as part of a feeling I had to re-read a number of books that I had read back when I was in 12th grade, and I think it served its purpose to that degree, but I also feel like the time in which I had read it back then, it felt fairly relevant (that was the beginning of the pandemic, which might be why).  

Some people might be put off by the style of writing of the author, or by the main character itself (maybe in the way they speak or something else), which I can totally understand and see. I myself was sometimes put off by certain descriptions and styles of writings at some point, but it didn't really hamper the experience all that much.  

The book is an immense joy, and it's really quite beautiful. There are many statements of truth and love throughout the book that I really appreciated reading, and I love just the way the book feels. I remember my English teacher back then said something along the lines of how it was one of the few books that once he had finished, he had to read again - and I can absolutely see why.  

I recommend it! Read it!!
