# The Overcoat and Other Short Stories

#### Nikolai Gogol

*March 23, 2023*  

4/5  

The collection of stories here were indeed rather interesting. Firstly I will note that quite often there are 
references to "little Russia", of which I will ignore the political consequences in this r. They are rather big 
consequences, and they are interesting considerations. I actually learned of Nikolai Gogol first through those 
consequences, through [an article by the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/30/rereading-russian-classics-in-the-shadow-of-the-ukraine-war).  

The stories themselves were very charming otherwise, and often very humorous. There were quite a few moments I 
caught myself laughing, as opposed to just smiling or exhaling with a small degree of sharpness.  

Particularly enjoyable was the story "The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarelled with Ivan Nikiforovich", which 
was the main cause for much of my laughter. The first story too, "Old Fashioned Farmers", was a very pleasant 
read.  

I do recommend that these stories may be read, more so for pleasure and enjoyment, so long as you are able and 
willing to ignore certain choice wording.
