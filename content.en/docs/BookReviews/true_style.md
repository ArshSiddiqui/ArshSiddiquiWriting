# True Style: The History and Principles of Classic Menswear 

#### G. Bruce Boyer

*November 9, 2024*

4/5

This is pretty good, better than I was expecting. My current perspective on fashion has moved far away from menswear, particularly classic menswear, but this is still an excellent novel. It is more of a discussion of fashion and clothing with certain suggestions and offerings, but it isn't necessarily a guide on how to dress. (There is no proper guide on how to dress).

I think there are two worlds of menswear, the Gentleman's Gazette side and the Derek Guy side, I clearly prefer the Derek Guy side, it's much friendlier and far more fun. I think G. Bruce Boyer's work is a good bridge between the two, this novel makes that distinction feel more clear to me. 

One other note, Boyer is quite funny, like a lot more so than I was expecting out of this novel.  

Read it maybe if you're into fashion?
