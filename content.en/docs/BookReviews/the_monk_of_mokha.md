# The Monk of Mokha

#### Dave Eggers

*July 29, 2024*

4/5

I did really enjoy this book, especially considering how different it was from the books I had been reading lately. I don't typically tend to read many nonfiction books, but this one was given to me on account of my interest in coffee.  

I did learn a lot from this book, not just about the life of Mokhtar Alkhanshali himself but also about coffee. The information was really well presented in a well written manner. I did enjoy learning.  

It's not purely information about coffee, of course. Most of the novel is about Mokhtar's life itself, which is really interesting.  

I think it's a good book. At the end, it felt a bit fast, and I was left expecting a bit more, but I suppose that is less necessary in comparison to the story that was written.  

Read it!
