# If on a Winter's Night a Traveler 

#### Italo Calvino

*September 6, 2023*  

5/5  

This is a genuinely incredible book. I haven't read a whole lot of experimental bookse (I don't 
know if you can call this that), but I believe this is a postmodern work. The concept itself 
instantly hooked me, and everything with the progression of the story, and the story upon story 
nature of the book, kept me engaged.  

It was, surely, confusing at points for me, but I had definitely found this to be a rewarding 
book, one of the more rewarding pieces of literature that I have read yet. Each chapter had 
ideas and writing unto itself, and the nature of that juxtaposition enriched the literary 
context immensely.  

This book is also surprisingly funny, and funny in weird ways. I found myself laughing at 
things I wasn't expecting to. It's also very insightful, the second to last chapter was a 
really interesting dissection and provided a lot of interesting thoughts.  

I can't really summarize this book into one idea, I can only recommend it.
