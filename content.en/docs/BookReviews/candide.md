# Candide  

#### Voltaire

*January 24, 2024*  

5/5  

I had read this book last in high school as part of my English class. I remember enjoying it enough at that time to have read the whole book and at least be somewhat able to discuss it in class. Reading it again recently, I am surprised at how much more enjoyable it was for me. It could very well be something due to the timing of me reading, or with respect to my current circumstances or thoughts.  

One thing I should say is that this book is really genuinely quite funny, moreso than I had ever really realized. I genuinely found myself laughing quite a lot more than I was expecting to going into the book.  

Additionally, I guess this is to be expected, but there is quite a lot to think about and consider when reading the book. Of course the state of the lives of people is always interesting to consider, but the book does make you think mayhaps a bit differently about your fellow people. The last chapter in particular is one that really struck out from across time, and I remember enjoying it then, and really enjoying it now.
