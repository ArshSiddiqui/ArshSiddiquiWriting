# Utopia

#### Thomas More

*June 14, 2022*  

4/5  

Utopia is a satirical novel on English politics of the time period, at least I reckon. It describes one 
man's experience with a "Utopian land" and goes into detail about life and the inhabitants of the island.  

I find this to be overall a great book, I found that the format of the novel (between the first half 
which was more of a discussion of the troubles with English politics at the time, and the second half 
which focused solely on Utopia and its state of affairs) to be generally quite good as a discussion of 
"Utopia" and as a comparison to human-like life and politics.  

This book is a satire, though I must say that after finishing it, I didn't really find many satirical 
elements to it, but that would probably be because I'm not a great reader, I didn't really analyze/delve 
into the book (or the author's time period), and my frame of reference going into the book may have not 
been the best. However, this novel certainly is still very impactful, relevant, and important regardless 
of whether one can or can't experience the satirical elements throughout.  

I would recommend that one read this book, I found it quite good, and it really is a fascinating read, 
experiencing another's viewpoint of the world. Asking a person, especially one so educated as Sir Thomas 
Moore, about what they would see a perfect world to be down to the distribution of food, is interesting, 
and can paint a great image of the world that the author lived in at the time.  

Based on that, I think that anybody who wants to learn more about politics (the history of politics 
in particular I'd guess) may find this book quite interesting.  

Thanks for reading!
