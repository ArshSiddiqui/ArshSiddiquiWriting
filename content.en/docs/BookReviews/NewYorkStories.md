# New York Stories

#### Diana Secker Tesdell (Editor)

*January 12, 2023*  

5/5  

Fantastic collection of stories, most if not all were a tremendous read and I found some really interesting 
authors that I'd definitely like to do more research into.

Some of the stories felt very cozy and relaxed ("A Snowy Night on West-Forty Ninth Street" for example), 
others had a really captivating story that was hard to put down (like "Sonny's Blues" and "Negocios").

Overall a very enjoyable collection of short stories that are pleasant to quickly pick up and read.
