# Kafka on the Shore

#### Haruki Murakami

*August 18, 2022*  

3/5  

I could tell while reading this book that it is good, but my experience with this book was rather wierd 
and meandering per se.  

This book tells the story of two people, one is a student that flees from his father and home to live on 
his own. The other is of an older very simple man who can talk to cats. Both stories are great and engaging, 
but the story of the student didn't play too well with me. At some times I really enjoyed reading about his 
aspects and became captivated by the progression of his stories. But at other times, it felt kind of slow 
and not really in my wheelhouse. The story of the older man though I really loved. I found his story to be 
really captivating and engaging, and I really enjoyed how he was written across the book. Additionally, 
his story became more interesting and engaging as the novel progressed. So too did the other story, 
but there were moments for me that were detracting. Certain parts of the students story felt unnecessary to me.  

I think that I need to read this book again. It clearly feels like a good book, but I came out of it a 
bit mixed.  

I think this would be a great book for someone with the right headspace, though I'm not sure when or if 
I'll ever be there.  
Thanks!
