Far and away one of the most interesting books I've ever read before. I really don't want to say much to anything about this book, because I think it is really best read knowing quite literally as little as possible. I didn't know who the KLF were or who any of the other people in this book were till I read it, and if you'd like to read this book, I think it might be best if you do the same!

Something I will say is how this book came to me. I was first aware of it through a series that Tom Scott put out a while ago titled "How to Becomes Famous on the Internet". In the third and last video, he brought up the central action of this book and discussed a book by the KLF called "The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)", and for some reason that I can't fully remember, that put me down the path to finding this book. Again much later, this book came up through the Shakespeare and Co. podcast, with the author discussing the 90s in great depth. These occurrences from these specific areas were more than enough for me to come to read this book.

I recommend this book.
