# The Learners

#### Chip Kidd

*January 1, 2024*  

5/5

I hadn't actually heard of Chip Kidd until I started reading this book, and for some strange reason, I began this book thinking it was an autobiography. This book I have a bit of trouble explaining, it shows, in some sense, the use and importance of graphic design in our world, and there are some fantastic spreads and gags in the book related to it. In another sense, though, this book questions the innate sense of or sentiment of humanity, at our core selves.  

The pivot that occurs in this book, and the direction it began to take, I think was perfectly pointed in this book and came just at the right time. For both the book and myself.  

It does pose a lot of questions about our innate behavior, and I do wonder more as a consequence of it. I think it makes the narrator a lot more relatable as a consequence. I want to follow the rules but my brain does function on its own.  

It's a good book! Read it!
