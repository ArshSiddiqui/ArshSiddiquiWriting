# A Tale of Two Cities

#### Charles Dickens

*November 17, 2021*  

5/5  

I bought this book on a whim about a year ago, but didn't start reading it till not long ago. I was 
told by a good friend that it wasn't all that it was chopped up to be, so I went in with little thought.  

I will say that the book began kind of slowly, but I enjoyed it all the same. At the halfway point, when 
the French Revolution begins is when the book really picks up steam, and it was at this point when I could 
not put the book down.  

**Potential spoilers following**  

Sitting in history class learning about the French Revolution and the horrors of the Rein of Terror is one 
thing for certain. It is easy to throw around statistics of deaths of the time, but using statistics to 
represent deaths is unfair in some sense. This book really made me feel for all those lives lost and families 
unnecessarily impacted by the Revolution. The final chapter, and the final few paragraphs are truly something 
to behold, and left me a little sad I daresay.  

I highly recommend this read, it is a great book, there is no doubt about that in my mind.
