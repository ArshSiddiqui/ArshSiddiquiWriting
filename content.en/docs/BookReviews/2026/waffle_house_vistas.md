# **Waffle House Vistas**

I wouldn't be considered a southerner by anybody except for those not living in the south, but I've been to a Waffle House a few times in my life, with most memories being from the one by my university. I think the way Cash evoked the simulacra of Waffle House to be true in my, albeit limited, experience. His work here expands on a common American experience and relates it to our broader moment in a way that feels pertinent.

I imagine this collection of photos and essays would hit harder to a person more attuned to southern culture, but now I have something to look forward to and think about the next time I go to a Waffle house.
