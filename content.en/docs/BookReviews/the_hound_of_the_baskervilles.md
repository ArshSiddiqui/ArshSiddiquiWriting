# The Hound of The Baskervilles

#### Arthur Conan Doyle

*June 27, 2024*

5/5

Excellent, of course. I've enjoyed Holmes for a long while in my life, and I had taken a course on Detective Fiction in University a few years back. We did cover this book, so this is the second time I'm reading it.   

It really is, for a majority of the story, more of a horror novel than a mystery novel. Mystery is being done and being solved, to be true, but in a manner different to previous Holmes novels. I'll spare the details to not ruin the experience for newcomers.  

It's very atmospheric, the settings have persisted in my mind for a long while, and will continue to.  

Read it!
