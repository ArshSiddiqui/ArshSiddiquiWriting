# The Joy Luck Club

4/5  

This is a pretty good book. I finished reading it a while ago, and I don't totally remember what I thought because my mind was foggy, but I recall a fair bit. It's really quite good, and the juxtaposition between the stories of the daughters and their mothers informing their lives and decisions is quite interesting and well done.  

I will say, it is interesting reading this with the time difference. The children in the book are baby boomers, so reading it now funny, in that the ways in which I am aware of the dichotomy between children of immigrants and their parents are very different. I'm not sure if that's due to my own upbringing or generational differences, but it's likely both.  

It's something that should be kept in mind as you read it.
