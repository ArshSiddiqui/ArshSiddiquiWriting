# The Man Who Died Twice

#### Richard Osman

*June 26, 2022*  

5/5  

This was a genuinely lovely read. I don't know whether I more so consider it to be a mystery or 
comedy, but it is certainly a bit of both. There were moments reading it where I genuinely laughed 
out loud, and that hardly happens to me with books, so that was a lovely surprise. This book is a bit 
more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I've read, but that's probably due to the 
subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.  

There were a few gripes I do have with the novel, two in fact. Firstly, a lot of the intrigue happens 
a bit late in the book, so I found myself reading somewhat slowly for the first two thirds of the book, 
and the speeding it and the last mark. This is, of course, expected (especially for a mystery novel), 
but I felt the balance was a bit skewed. This hardly impacted my enjoyment of the novel though. Secondly, 
there were a lot of moments were you could mistake our septuagenarians for being more middle aged, but I 
wasn't too bothered by this either.  

Overall this was a fantastic and fun read, I'd recommend you read it if you want to try something a little 
lighthearted, and funny all the same!
