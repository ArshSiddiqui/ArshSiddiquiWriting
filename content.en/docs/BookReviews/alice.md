# Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass

#### Lewis Carroll

*August 6, 2024*

4/5

I think I had read this book a rather long time ago, but I don't really remember. Frankly, I mostly remembered some of the random films I had seen that adapted these books. Those films were terrible, in retrospect, and the stories here are rather good as written.  

These stories are really pleasant. Much moreso than I was expecting (probably because of those films). And they're really quite funny. I caught myself laughing at just the insanity on display in various chapters.  

The stories are also rather calm, and that characteristic is much appreciated. I don't think all stories need to have high drama and tension, and I can appreciate a story that feels simple.  

Read it!
