# For Whom The Bell Tolls

#### Ernest Hemingway

*June 30, 2023*  

5/5  

A brilliant book to be sure. All that I have read of Hemingway I have enjoyed very much, his style of writing just feels extremely natural, funny enough. It really makes all of the internal monologue just go by smoothly because that sort of internal monologue feels natural in the way it has been written, like a real internal monologue.  

Much of this book is written in that deign, thus making the writing itself an absolute joy to take in.  

The story is brilliant as well, of course. It is easy to imagine the single track mind one may have at many phases of life, or when one has received friction from another, but the duality of much experiences is something one mustn't forget. It was interesting for me to see butchery in this way, both in the lens of what "we" did and what "they" did. This may be obvious to many, but I would have had a horse in this race so to speak, so a lot of my mind would be blind to that.  

There is no need for me really to reflect on the tragedy of war here, that's what this story (and many others) and there for.  

I can only recommend this book.
