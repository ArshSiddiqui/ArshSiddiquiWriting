# **The Seige of Krishnapur**

<h4>Author <span>JG Farrell</span></br>

Rating <span>5/5</span></h4>

While this was a slow read for me, I found the book to take on deeper value as time went on. Farrell's depiction of colonialism here is quite intriguing, it made the British empire feel more like band-aid slapped together than I would have realized. The characters, too, feel very similar at the end to what they were like at the beginning, any change that may have come to them has left quickly. Regardless, matters of social standing and things we may find rather foolish are held at high importance throughout the exceedingly dire trajectory the British troupe finds themselves in. This is an excellent novel.
