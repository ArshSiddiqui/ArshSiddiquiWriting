Sayaka Murata might seem an anomaly. These stories feel like they would break _The Tower of Babel_, and yet, they exist. I really do like them. I think these stories may be perceieved as just wierd and _quirky_, whatever that is supposed to mean, but this is really Sayaka Murata. I wouldn't have believed it either, had I not read [her profile in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/sayaka-muratas-alien-eye). I think this is just her.

I can understand why people say that her stories have changed their life. That sort of effect I feel like would come from stories like these. I really like these stories, regardless of how off kilter they might be.

There was a really great line in that article, "Murata was offering a corrective to “a worldwide trend, especially on social media,” of believing totally in the self-evident rightness of current norms". I felt this strongly throughout the entire novel, and it has made me re-think a lot of pre-conceptions I might have had. At least those that felt _obvious_ for whatever reason that might be.
