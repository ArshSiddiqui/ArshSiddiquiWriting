# The Martian Chronicles

#### Ray Bradbury

*July 23, 2023*  

5/5

Potential spoilers ahead.

I went into this book thinking that it would have a linear storyline, but found that not to be the case. The story was rather a collection of stories about humanity on and dealing with Mars. Initially, I thought this would have me lose interest in the book itself, but I was proved to be very much so wrong. I think that the nature of this book being a collection of short stories about humans on Mars was incredible, and I feel like it gave me a way as to be able to see how humans would act, and not just one tribe of humans.

This is an incredible novel, and I feel like much of what it has to say about humanity remains true to this day. I'd recommend it!
