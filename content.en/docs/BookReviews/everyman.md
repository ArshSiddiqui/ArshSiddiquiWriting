#### Philip Roth

*July 10, 2023*  

4/5

This was the first book of Phillip Roth I've read before. I mostly know of him through the Paris Review and the New Yorker. It's a rather interesting novel at its core. Indeed, it is about an old man reminiscing upon his life, and all the decisions he has made in it. How time has ravaged and somehow has not forgot. How human nature can be unchanging.

It feels to me, though, not like many stories I have read before. It is unique by its very nature, and by the concerns it chooses to tackle. I think this is to its benefit, and I can certainly say it is a fantastic novel. Though, I also daresay that in some ways it really does feel more like a guide to ageing than it does feel like a classic story.

It is certainly thought provoking on the issue of age and on the issue of death. I think it's a pretty good book.
