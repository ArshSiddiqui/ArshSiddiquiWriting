# A Streetcar Named Desire

#### Tennessee Williams

*Febuary 5, 2024*  

5/5  

This was another book I read back in high school. It was the first book that I felt that I could understand at a literary level. That was, of course, thanks in part to my English professor. Even still, reading the book again is quite an interesting experience. To one degree, I felt like, reading it again at this instance, I was able to catch even more things that I hadn't caught before, and noticed things I hadn't noticed before. And in another sense, the book felt very clear and comprehensible to me.

This is a really incredible drama, I must say. In thinking about the novel and imagining the change of the country, and particularly the south at this time, the book does give a lot to think about.

It does just make me think a lot. Maybe it still gets me confused, but I think it does so in the right way.
