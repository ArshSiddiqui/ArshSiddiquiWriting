# My Listens
My inital listens page (below this one in the index) was built upon `Spotipy`. After a friend had introduced me to scrobbling (and after I had tired of listening to commercials within Spotify itself, and with the fact that Spotify had recently rehauled their API), I had found that it was time for a change. The below shows a more accurate idea of the list of songs that I have been listening to. This will update every two hours as the music itself that I listen to changes, just as before.

As of late, I have been listening to a lot of music by <span id="art1"></span>, <span id="art2"></span>, and <span id="art3"></span>. With respect to the albums I have been listening to, <span id="alb1"></span>, <span id="alb2"></span>, and <span id="alb3"></span> have been coming up a lot.
