# The Best Short Stories I Have Read

feel reading stories and think about things more deeply than I would otherwise, or maybe they were just a 
fun read. They are organized in terms of publication date.

[The Third Law of Magic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/ben-okri-short-story-third-law-magic/672783/?utm_source=pocket_saves)  
A story about art, and the difficulty of expression. Ongoing is an interesting dissection of the contrast 
of the artist (or perhaps an artist) between the interior - their thoughts, feelings, and ideals - and their 
exterior - their presentation and execution of their work.
