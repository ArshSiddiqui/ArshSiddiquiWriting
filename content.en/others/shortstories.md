# The Best Short Stories I Have Read

These are some of the best short stories I have read. These have made me feel things I would not normally
feel reading stories and think about things more deeply than I would otherwise, or maybe they were just a 
fun read. They are organized in terms of publication date.

[The Third Law of Magic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/ben-okri-short-story-third-law-magic/672783/?utm_source=pocket_saves)  
A story about art, and the difficulty of expression. Ongoing is an interesting dissection of the contrast 
of the artist (or perhaps an artist) between the interior - their thoughts, feelings, and ideals - and their 
exterior - their presentation and execution of their work.

[The Ihop Years](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/david-sedaris-the-ihop-years)  
Anything written by David Sedaris is generally a fantastic read, this was no exception to that. It details
his time in Chicago, when he was at the Art Institute of Chicago just up til when he moved to New York City.
This is, of course, a humurous story and rather pleasant.
