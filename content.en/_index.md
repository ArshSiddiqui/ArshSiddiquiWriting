## About Me

Hello! My name is Arsh Siddiqui and I am a senior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute 
and State University pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in 
Economics. I am also an undergraduate research assistant who has helped to develop 
a taxonomy for audio augmented reality (with its applications) and has also 
performed research in how augmented reality based music can enhance the experience
of artwork.
