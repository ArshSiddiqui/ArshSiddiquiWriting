## About Me

My name is Arsh Siddiqui and I am a junior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute 
and State University pursuing a major in computer science with a minor in 
economics. I am also an undergraduate research assistant helping to develop 
a taxonomy for audio augmented reality (with its applications) and also currently 
performing research in how augment reality based music can enhance the experience
of artwork.
