# Murder in the Cathedral

#### T.S. Elliot 

*November 12, 2024*

5/5

This is excellent and such a delight to read. The prose reads so beautifully, so incredibly, I felt compelled to read it out loud.

The story itself is also great: perhaps the core concepts of the story have been discussed many time before, but it's still rather nice.

> The last temptation is the greatest treason:  
> To do the right thing for the wrong reason.  
> The natural vigour in the venial sin  
> Is the way in which our lives begin.
