# **Down and Out in Paris and London**

<h4>Author <span class='book_header'>George Orwell</span></br>Date <span class='book_header'>July 26, 2025</span></br>Rating <span class='book_header'>4/5</span></h4>

This is a really well made book and honestly depresses me immensely. Orwell makes some really great commentary through certain chapters of the book, delving into discussions of certain facets of homelessness. He is very excellently able to describes aspects of this life, and this book is by far the best descriptor of poverty that I have read yet.
