# The Murder of Roger Ackroyd  

#### Agatha Christie

*September 30, 2024*

5/5

Another book that I read for a detectice fuction class! I am re-reading it, just like many others.   

It's quite impressive, but I really wish I could have read it at the time it came out. The book really is something that is quite conniving for its time, but reading it now, you don't really get to experience that or understand that to the same degree.  

Even still, it did swindle me the first time I read it, and it was very amusing. Read it!
