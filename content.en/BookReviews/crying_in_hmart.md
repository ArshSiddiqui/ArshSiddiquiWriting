# Crying In H Mart

5/5  

This is fully the first book I've read this year and I wouldn't be surprised if it stays the best book I've read this year. I don't think I really have the words to describe this book.  

I'll say that it's one of the saddest books I've read before and one of the few books I could very genuinely feel. In two ways. The two primary ways I've been thinking about this book was in one sense in terms of the primary story itself, and then additionally in terms of race.  

Although I myself am not mixed race, my appearance is not commonly viewed with the perception of my race. A lot of what I felt like growing up in terms of my own race to what I feel today mirrors what the author feels. And then the juxtaposition of that with respect to, in her case, one of her parents, felt very real. I'll leave it at that here.  

Read it!
