# Paris

5/5  

This is a book that I have read a good many times in my life, but it's been a while since I last read 
it and I haven't yet reviewed it so I figured that I'd give it a go.  

This book discusses the history of Paris over about 1000 years (I think) through the perspectives of 
many different families of different upbringings, stories, and political perspectives. I find this very 
concept quite fascinating. It allows you to make your own character, put them in a turbulent time in history 
and just see what happens. The way families change (or don't change) is nice to see, and this sort of 
character development is interesting in a historical perspective.  

I really enjoyed this novel, but I can see understand a lot of the arguments for issues within it. The 
book does have a lot of random historical facts and explanations, which do come up incredibly frequently 
(like every other paragraph). I can understand why someone would find this to really take you out of the 
story, but it wasn't really ever an issue for me.  

I have found this book to be effectively a comforting read for me, and every time I've read it, I notice, 
or learn, something new. I quite liked the book, and I recommend you read it if you are interested in the 
history of Paris or want a nice read that you could get something out of. Thanks!
