# Victory

#### Joseph Conrad

*December 21, 2022*  

3/5  

This book took me a long time to read, it wasn't its fault, though, more of mine.  

I'd say the book was pretty good, albeit a little bit slow for my tastes throughout much of 
the beginning and middle of the book.  

The ending was absolutely fantastic and when a lot of the writing really came through and shone for me.  

The setting and description of place that highlighted certain scenes and acts in the story were 
done fantastically, and did help me lose myself in the plot.  

It's pretty good, I reckon I should read it again sometime in the future.
