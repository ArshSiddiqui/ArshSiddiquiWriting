I had read that book at a consequential point in my life, and this book once again finds its way into my sight at another consequential moment. Perhaps it is for these reasons I do not see the book in the same light as many others.\nThis book has meant a lot to me as I had read it. And that is mostly due in part to the fact that it was the one escape I had from life. I kept going back and back to it to avoid staring at the wall in vain. It was helpful. The story was very engrossing, as can be presumed. The fact that it was so engrossing helped me feel better, to be true.\nThe story is really quite good, and I really do like magical realism, so that would influence my perception of it. I think the fact that it was magical realism helped me with the real world too. Maybe, or maybe not, I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure for sure. Regardless, the story was immaculate, and I kept wanting to come back for more.\nStill though, even with my state of affairs and my continued great interest in the story, many things did bother me greatly about the book. Most prominently in that the author does not appear to know how to write women. This is already well known about Murakami so I am presumably just jumping on something already miles high. Even still, the derangement with which some of the lines and statements were made was just so absurd as to be totally offputting and take me out of the book greatly.\nRegardless, it\u0026rsquo;s still quite good, and it helped me a lot when I really needed it, and I can thank Murakami for that much at least.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/bookreviews/afarewelltoarms/","title":"A Farewell to Arms","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rA Farewell to Arms\r#\rErnest Hemingway\r#\rMarch 6, 2023\n5/5\nThis was a very enjoyable book overall, and one heck of a story for sure. I haven\u0026rsquo;t read very many books about war, WW1 included, so this was definitely a great introduction.\nThe story itself is based upon Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s time serving as an ambulance driver working for the Italian military, where he had met a nurse he\u0026rsquo;d fallen in love with. I won\u0026rsquo;t say much more nor how his tale differs from the book itself, but keeping that in mind made the book (and the twists and turns of the story itself) more interesting.\nOne thing I really enjoyed about the story was the nature of the characters in terms of the wider scope of the narrative. Deaths being both tragic and meaningless at the same time often came into the foray, and mingled with useless murder. Hearing individuals discuss and debate the virtues (namely the lack thereof) of their situations gave more of a \u0026ldquo;what is it good for\u0026rdquo; flavor to the story that I, for one, appreciated.\nThis is definitely a great book that I would highly recommend.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/bookreviews/a_gentleman_in_moscow/","title":"A Gentleman in Moscow","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rA Gentleman in Moscow\r#\rAmor Towles\r#\rMarch 14, 2024\n5/5\nThe first time I had read this book, it was under the recommendation of a number of people I had respected, particularly my English teacher at the time. I had taken quite a long time to read it then, but the book really hit me at that time. Reading it again, it\u0026rsquo;s probably actually hit me harder this time, but I feel like I read it too quickly, even though I still took like a month. I wanted to read it again as part of a feeling I had to re-read a number of books that I had read back when I was in 12th grade, and I think it served its purpose to that degree, but I also feel like the time in which I had read it back then, it felt fairly relevant (that was the beginning of the pandemic, which might be why).\nSome people might be put off by the style of writing of the author, or by the main character itself (maybe in the way they speak or something else), which I can totally understand and see. I myself was sometimes put off by certain descriptions and styles of writings at some point, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t really hamper the experience all that much.\nThe book is an immense joy, and it\u0026rsquo;s really quite beautiful. There are many statements of truth and love throughout the book that I really appreciated reading, and I love just the way the book feels. I remember my English teacher back then said something along the lines of how it was one of the few books that once he had finished, he had to read again - and I can absolutely see why.\nI recommend it!

Even still, reading the book again is quite an interesting experience. To one degree, I felt like, reading it again at this instance, I was able to catch even more things that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t caught before, and noticed things I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed before. And in another sense, the book felt very clear and comprehensible to me.\nThis is a really incredible drama, I must say. In thinking about the novel and imagining the change of the country, and particularly the south at this time, the book does give a lot to think about.\nIt does just make me think a lot.

It is easy to throw around statistics of deaths of the time, but using statistics to represent deaths is unfair in some sense. This book really made me feel for all those lives lost and families unnecessarily impacted by the Revolution.

David MarxDate July 3, 2025Rating 5/5\rDue to the nature of my relationship with fashion, it will be hard to give a good review of this book, plus if you are interested in fashion, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably already seen a lot of really great discussions of the ideas and history outlined in this book. Needless to say, I really loved this book. In lieu of a proper review, I will provide a few trains of thought I had whilst reading this book:\nIt is quite interesting to see how much I am learning about American culture of the past through a book analyzing the Japanese perspective on it. While I do know about Japanese fashion magazines (and own a few copies of different publications), I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that they had origins in various American stylings and cultures (and even our own magazines). I do like a lot of fashion magazines, but for some reason the ones I gravitate to the most are Japanese or French, and not our American counterparts. This book\u0026rsquo;s analysis of how these magazines came to fruition in Japan I think help me understand where this disconnect comes from.\nSide note: I think part of the reason I like certain Japanese and French fashion magazines more than their American counterparts is partly due to a greater focus on celebrity culture in American magazines. This isn\u0026rsquo;t true everywhere, there are a lot of really good niche fashion magazines out there that are just about fashion and the culture surrounding it, but the most famous American fashion magazines feel like they verge towards \u0026ldquo;tabloid\u0026rdquo; in their pursuit of celebrity clothing.\nDue to the way that every fashion stylism here is divided into \u0026ldquo;tribes\u0026rdquo;, it really makes trend choices in fashion more obviously just a tribe identifier as opposed to a \u0026ldquo;factual good\u0026rdquo;. I see a lot of the youth in the current generation of fashion proselytizing wider silhouettes (especially for pants) as being definitively better than slimmer silhouettes, where the opposite was done by the previous fashion generation. Of course, both arguments may have merits on certain claims, but when everything is lined up with different fashion styles and tribes (as it is in this book), it\u0026rsquo;s very clear to see that these choices are just means of affiliating yourself with a specific tribe. Wearing wider jeans might be more comfortable than wearing slimmer jeans (in this cultural moment), but it does also help you identify yourself as young and as gen-z, which is arguably more important. I may be wrong in this understanding, but as I read more about tribes in this book, some aspects of style there felt similar. I mean, we\u0026rsquo;re already seeing some young people wearing slim Heidi Slimane like outfits in contrast to the more popular wider silhouettes of this moment, but are these both not just tribes? Neither choice is \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, they just feel to me like cultural identifiers.\nThe way in which Japanese youth would fall into these tribes also reminds me of what modern fashion feels like out here in the west. It\u0026rsquo;s noted in the book that there would be, for example, more people interested in dressing like a California surfer than would actually surf. This feels pretty similar to how modern aesthetics are frequently used to make a person seem apart of an in-group without having to actually participate in the non-aesthetic parts of that group. For instance, a while ago, a lot of people dressed to appear like they lived in a cottage and did subsistence farming, but weren\u0026rsquo;t actually doing those things. I don\u0026rsquo;t personally find anything wrong with this, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just people trying to find styles and things they\u0026rsquo;re interested in (and perhaps as a form of escapism), but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see that this isn\u0026rsquo;t a uniquely modern phenomena.\nThe afterword is quite interesting and provides some more current input on ametora, as it was written in 2023. The author mentions a lot about the impact of Uniqlo on modern fashion, both internationally, and on the American coasts. I feel like, now in 2025, the impact of Uniqlo is even more massive on at least American fashion, even with its history of labor abuses. Uniqlo appears to be seen as the default for generic clothing that will fit most or any situation, given it\u0026rsquo;s quality for price dichotomy. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to beat Uniqlo, and I can now understand where Uniqlo\u0026rsquo;s production history and quality would come from, thanks to the history provided in this book. All the same, while I do really appreciate the major impact Uniqlo has had on American and global fashion, I still think it has a long way to go to become a more ideal clothing label. I mentioned earlier Uniqlo\u0026rsquo;s history of labor abuses, which is of course common among a large number of modern inexpensive clothing retailers, but there is also a question of environmental impact, which is another notable concern with Uniqlo. Of course, there are no silver bullets here on the consumption side of things, the best thing to do is to just not consume more clothes, allowing you to not partake in both the labor exploitation and the environmental exploitation. Regardless, I did really like how the author talked about modern Japanese street wear and Uniqlo in the afterword, it tied together a lot of things that I am at least vaguely aware of at this moment with everything he discussed earlier.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/bookreviews/unsuitable_job_for_a_woman/","title":"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rAn Unsuitable Job for a Woman\r#\rP.D.

I also read this book for a course in detective fiction, but I recall having quite fond memories of the time in which I had read it, I think an unseasonably warm Autumn.\nPart of that like I think had to deal with the immaculate descriptions of the environment the novel takes place in, being Cambridge. The novel really makes it feel like such a real and warm place, hightening a contrast with the \u0026ldquo;detective\u0026rdquo; aspects itself.\nThe story itself is excellent, and the unraveling of the tale comes very cleanly and nicely.

Reading it again recently, I am surprised at how much more enjoyable it was for me. It could very well be something due to the timing of me reading, or with respect to my current circumstances or thoughts.\nOne thing I should say is that this book is really genuinely quite funny, moreso than I had ever really realized. I genuinely found myself laughing quite a lot more than I was expecting to going into the book.\nAdditionally, I guess this is to be expected, but there is quite a lot to think about and consider when reading the book. Of course the state of the lives of people is always interesting to consider, but the book does make you think mayhaps a bit differently about your fellow people.

I came across this book thanks to Dami Lee and her videos on architecture, notably one on the development of Tokyo.\nI am no urban designer or architect, I merely find these subjects to be quite interesting, probably in part due to greater online discourse in these subjects (notably urban planning) in recent years. Unfortunately, a great deal of this online discourse is very euro-centric, tending to miss valuable insight that other cities from around the world. Tokyo, however, does tend to get discussed a great deal even with the euro-centrism present in these communities, however this leads to a very orientalist view of Tokyo (and Japanese cities more broadly), other-ifying a city and community that we can learn a lot from. Jorge Almazán\u0026rsquo;s book Emergent Tokyo is one of the few pieces of reading I have engaged with that has laid this fact bare, and then analyzed Tokyo with this understanding.\nThe lens by which the principles of Tokyo\u0026rsquo;s ground-up development are discussed (through emergence), is incredibly interesting, and something I feel a lot of modern urbanists neglect. I think a lot of people know that corporate-led urbanism tends to feel unsavour, or tends to feel rather exclusionary, but, at least for me, it tends to be difficult to fully understand why I feel that way. Almazán\u0026rsquo;s analysis on how these environment are shaped, and on how they differ to more agglomerative, community-based environments, makes the distinction bare. Now it seems I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to not see any of the things he discusses or warns about in this book in the cities that I have lived in.\nThis is a really great read.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/bookreviews/everyman/","title":"Everyman","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rEveryman\r#\rPhilip Roth\r#\rJuly 10, 2023\n4/5\nThis was the first book of Phillip Roth I\u0026rsquo;ve read before.

How human nature can be unchanging.\nIt feels to me, though, not like many stories I have read before. It is unique by its very nature, and by the concerns it chooses to tackle. I think this is to its benefit, and I can certainly say it is a fantastic novel. Though, I also daresay that in some ways it really does feel more like a guide to ageing than it does feel like a classic story.\nIt is certainly thought provoking on the issue of age and on the issue of death.

The idea captivated me much when I was younger: that of the idle wanderer in the city who becomes, to some degree, part of the urban fabric as they wander through it. For much of its history, the flâneur was purely a masculine figure, as for a very long time women did not, could not, wander through the city freely by themselves. Part of this came from the perception of women who wandered cities alone as prostitutes, or as otherwise negative individuals. This book wishes to show the relationship between women and their cities in a true light.\nI really like a lot of aspects of this book, but I did also feel like there were some things missing, or some things that could have been expanded upon. For one, I liked how Elkin chose a specific figure for each city and chapter, giving each city a richer story that framed it in a historical context and through the wanderings of that person. This also reveals what these cities came to mean for each of these women, be it a refuge, a new life, or something totally different. Elkin\u0026rsquo;s chapter on Tokyo was particularly interesting, even though it heavily focused on her own experience in the city. The chapter was twinged with a lot of negative feelings about her being pushed to move into a city completely foreign to her and for being ridiculed for her cultural misunderstandings. In this way, the book does talk a lot about the experience of being an immigrant, or of being thrust into a new culture. I do wish this book had discussed more the feeling of breaking away from one\u0026rsquo;s home and the changes that it brings upon them. Elkin does talk about this to some degree, in her chapter on New York, but it felt much more related to those that she left behind, as opposed to how she herself feels. I think there is a pretty big difference between the experience one has of a city, when they are staying in a city for a short period of time versus living there full time. Elkin does talk a bit about this with her experience of Paris, but I think it could have been more in depth. I wonder how the city changes when you move away from seeing it in the lens of a foreigner, someone culturally removed though perhaps wishing to adapt, as opposed to the lens of a tourist, when you will be returning home soon enough.\nSide note about her chapter on Tokyo. Elkin was living in a neighborhood called Roppongi Hills during her time there. Many commentators of this book criticized this chapter on account of her describing Tokyo as being incredibly unwalkable, which the critics found laughable. To some degree, I understand their criticism, Tokyo is commonly seen as one of the best human-scaled cities in our modern world. However, not every neighborhood is equal, and Roppongi Hills is notoriously car friendly for a city like Tokyo. It has been established as effectively a corporate world that can feel devoid of any life, thus separate from the rest of Tokyo and what makes that city appealing. I found the continuous claims that Elkin \u0026ldquo;doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what she\u0026rsquo;s talking about\u0026rdquo; when it comes to Tokyo quite unfair when it is clear that she, in fact, was living in a comparatively unwalkable part of the city. If you are more interested in learning more about Tokyo, what makes it such a nice city, and about some of its faults, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend reading Emergent Tokyo: Designing the Spontaneous City, it does talk about this distinction a bit.\nI think this is a great book, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember this isn\u0026rsquo;t seeking to be an Arcades Project or a Nadja, this is seeking to reveal to the reader a side of the history of our cities that was left quietly to the side for a long time. I felt that disconnect between what I expected and what the book actually is at the beginning of this book. As time went on and as that expectation faded, I began to appreciate the book much more.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/bookreviews/forwhomthebelltolls/","title":"For Whom The Bell Tolls","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rFor Whom The Bell Tolls\r#\rErnest Hemingway\r#\rJune 30, 2023\n5/5\nA brilliant book to be sure.

It really makes all of the internal monologue just go by smoothly because that sort of internal monologue feels natural in the way it has been written, like a real internal monologue.\nMuch of this book is written in that deign, thus making the writing itself an absolute joy to take in.\nThe story is brilliant as well, of course. It is easy to imagine the single track mind one may have at many phases of life, or when one has received friction from another, but the duality of much experiences is something one mustn\u0026rsquo;t forget.

Firstly, langauge modeling is the use of a technique to determine the probablility of a sentence occuring with the words in it in that order. It is frequently used to create computer algorithms that will create intelligible sentences based upon some text corpus.\nI first began working with language models with the bag of words method, which simply categorizes all of the words in some given text into it based upon their appearance in the text. We can then take this categorization and output a randomized string of words based upon some randomness and word commonality. Using this method created sentences like this:\ntoo, no best than about clearly in know of in made of the the side one the of and the are customer From spots having found majority, from was been I-as Touch-me-Not a double The having armed dropped rank but which mer_. well week-once\nYeah, it isn\u0026rsquo;t very good, but it was a start. I then moved on to n-gram models. This effectively takes n - 1 words and uses them to predict the next word. So say we have a bi-gram (2-gram), this means that we can take a sentence and break it upon into groups of two words:\nThere is a dog named Allen.\n[ (There, is), (is, a), (a, dog), (dog, named), (named, Allen) ]\nUsing the occurences of bundled words together, when we give an algorithm a word, it can determine what comes next based upon the previous word (what normally comes up based upon our text corpus). I attemped to create an algorithm that worked based upon this method a while ago, though I believe that I created it incorrectly or did it poorly, because the final sentences again weren\u0026rsquo;t that great:\nno psyche within none within hair of like i brilliant i of thee in shore vogue land shore the native thy seas too whole grandeur agate thee stand inner long its here scorn ere scorn was byron which it safely remarkable estimate teens can none grandeur withering lamp withering\nI did, much later get back into language modeling. For a class project, a friend and I decided to create a trigram model, which is effectively the same as a bigram model but with n = 3. So that previous sentence would be broken down like this:\nThere is a dog named Allen.\n[ (There, is, a), (is, a, dog), (a, dog, named), (dog, named, Allen) ]\nSo instead of looking at the previous word to determine the next word, we would look at the previous two words to determine the next, and so on so forth. For this project (and all the previous), we used a library called nltk. This effectively just makes created all those bigrams and trigams much easier than they would otherwise be, and they make creating the models much easier. Our final product ended up being much better than the previous examples, as the following sentences exhibits (note that we used the novel \u0026ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo\u0026rdquo; for our text corpus here, whereas for the previous projects I had used a text corpus of Edgar Allen Poe stories):\nand then drew himself up with happiness, looking for all that you had conveyed a packet for Marshal Bertrand.\nthe night of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the city.\nYeah, those sentences aren\u0026rsquo;t that bad, I think.\nMore recently, I wanted to try to use a similar trigram algorithm on Edgar Allen Poe writing to create haikus. This would, of course, not only require text generation, but also need to have a way to convert the sentences that my text generation algorithm would create into haikus. Before I go on too far into that, let\u0026rsquo;s first look at the trigram model itself. Firstly, we need to open the text file and create the model:\nmodel = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: 0)) file = open(\u0026#34;EAPStories.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) The second line just opens the text file to be read only, while the first line creates the base for the model itself. Effectively what it is doing is creating a dictionary within a dictionary. This allows us to pair two words together to determine what the next possible words could be.\nfor line in file: for w1, w2, w3 in trigrams(line.lower().split(), pad_right=True, pad_left=True): model[(w1, w2)][w3] += 1 total_occurence = 0 for occurence in model[\u0026#39;the\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;day\u0026#39;].values(): total_occurence += occurence for w1w2 in model: for w3 in model[w1w2]: model[w1w2][w3] = model[w1w2][w3] / total_occurence dict(model[\u0026#39;and\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;then\u0026#39;]) {\u0026#39;went\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;obtain\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;: 0.12121212121212122,\r\u0026#39;returned,\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;from\u0026#39;: 0.030303030303030304,\r\u0026#39;caught\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;the\u0026#39;: 0.16666666666666666,\r\u0026#39;universal\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\r\u0026#39;felt\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152,\rNone: 0.12121212121212122,\r...\r\u0026#39;producing\u0026#39;: 0.015151515151515152} This code firstly goes through every line in the text file and splits the words up in very similar fashion to that of the \u0026ldquo;There is a dog named Allen\u0026rdquo; example I\u0026rsquo;d previously shown. The rest of the code takes every single possible third word to the first two words in the trigram, and determines the probability and word will come next based upon the total number of possibilities. This can be seen in the output, which is showing all of the possible concluding words to the two words \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;then\u0026rdquo;. Each word is correlated to a probability of its occurence. The \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; which can be seen as well just dictates the end of the sentence.\ndef create_sentence(word1, word2): sentence = [word1, word2] sentence_complete = False total_words = 0 num_words = 2 while not sentence_complete: min_words = random.random() for word in model[tuple(sentence[num_words - 2:])].keys(): total_words += model[tuple(sentence[num_words - 2:])][word] if total_words \u0026gt;= min_words: sentence.append(word) num_words += 1 break if sentence[num_words - 2:] == [None, None]: sentence_complete = True sentence_str = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for word in sentence: if word != None: sentence_str = sentence_str + word + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;create_sentence:\u0026#34;, sentence_str) return sentence While analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively. Here, we can also use some Python to calculate the returns between our start and end date and we can also use this to determine an average return across each year (or month if we wanted to do that as well).\ndays = 1000 years = days / 365 final_returns = 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1)[-1] print(\u0026#39;Return from start date to end date is: \u0026#39; + \u0026#39;{:.2f}\u0026#39;.format(final_returns) + \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) final_returns_per_year = final_returns / years print(\u0026#39;Average yearly return: \u0026#39; + \u0026#39;{:.2f}\u0026#39;.format(final_returns_per_year) + \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) Return from start date to end date is: 178.52%\rAverage yearly return: 65.16% This is finally the code that creates our sentences. What we are effectively doing is setting a random probability that we want each of our next words to achieve at a threshold. Then we continuously add these words to a list that will become our sentence. The sentence ends once we hit the word \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; (which refers to no word) twice.\nThis is similar to what we had done for the Monte Cristo trigam model, but I have changed some of the methods involved for simplicities sake.\nThe rest of the program will generate a sentence using the above function, checks how many syllables are in each word, and then attempt to create the three haiku lines with those words in their proper order. If it can\u0026rsquo;t, it scraps that sentence and generates a new one. This keeps going until a haiku is created. You can see one of the haikus that the algorithm generated at the top of this page.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/bookreviews/giraudoux/","title":"Giraudoux","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Madwoman of Bellac and The Apollo of Bellac\r#\rAuthor Jean GiraudouxDate July 9, 2025Rating 4/5\rThis is the second book I have read in French, and for that reason, I probably did not understand a great deal of what was going on. This is in part due to the way these plays are written, specifically in how a lot of speakers speak in very long drawn out paragraphs that feel like they contain very complicated vocabulary. Of course, it is complicated for a guy that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really speak French, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say if it is actually complicated for a fluent French speaker (probably not).\nRegardless, this is a pretty funny book! Even with the little I understood, I still found the way that Giraudoux writes stories and characters to be rather humourous.\nI would say that this edition is created pretty well. It has a dictionary / explanation for certain terms and phrases used throughout the plays that may be rather complicated, which are well written and quite useful to providing context to people who may not be as tuned into French culture or society (or language). This is definitely a good book for a person that speaks and reads French better than me, but also for people who are more interested in French playwrights and older French literature.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/bookreviews/gods_and_kings/","title":"Gods and Kings","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rGods and Kings: The Rise and Fall of Alexander McQueen and John Galliano\r#\rAuthor Dana ThomasDate August 22, 2025Rating 5/5\rThis is a good book, and it taught me a lot about a period in fashion history that I know almost nothing about. Due to that, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any overarching ideas I want to share about my experience here, but rather a few collected things of interest:\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure everybody knows this by this point, but fashion is actively killing itself with the amounts of runway shows designers are meant to take on each year. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if much has changed nowadays (my understanding is that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t), but actively reading Galliano and McQueen continuisly picking up yet more and more collections to present every year feels sickening to me. Sickening, not because it is necessarily bad, but because of the insane amounts of work they each require. The quality (in whatever capacity you define quality to be) is going to drop somewhere and we can\u0026rsquo;t all have nice collections all the time.\nWe complain about the repetitiveness of fashion nowadays in the world of online dressing, but I had never known that McQueen also criticized how designers kept pulling from the past for their current designs. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen more discussion online about the sameness in fashion nowadays, some of these discussions are good, some not so much, but McQueen showcasing the sameness in design shows how difficult it is to do something new. It makes me admire certain modern designers even more, that there are still people who are able to break away and do things not considered before.\nIt is odd seeing the Internet and things like Twitter appear at the end of this book. Although I recognize that McQueen and Galliano\u0026rsquo;s lifetimes have intersected with mine (one is still alive, after all), it\u0026rsquo;s still weird reading about this, when everything here feels decidedly not within my lifetime experiencing fashion. Some of these things feel like relics now, too, which feels weird given I uses to interact with them frequently\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/blog/los_angeles_grocery_stores/","title":"Grocery Stores in Los Angeles","section":"Blog","content":"\rGrocery Stores in Los Angeles\r#\rJanuary 3, 2024\nNowhere in particular\nQuite a while ago, I had taken a class at my university that covered a range of design based topics, one such relating to food scarcity and food deserts. According to Wikipedia, a food desert is \u0026ldquo;an area that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food\u0026rdquo;. To continue my work involving osmnx, I figured it might be interesting to consider areas in a city that might classify as a food desert, though I\u0026rsquo;ll use a much more fast and loose definition of a food desert here, simply due to my level of urban analysis, my patience, and the data available with respect to my knowledge of how to deal with it.\nThis time, I have decided to target Los Angeles, after having spent a few days there. My data comes from Los Angeles City Data, and is this dataset in particular. This is a listing of all \u0026ldquo;active grocery stores currently registered with the Office of Finance\u0026rdquo;. Now, some of these grocery stores might be unaffordable, and some of them may not provide nutritious food. I can\u0026rsquo;t say for certain whether these grocery stores might exist in a food desert or if their existence disallows the existence of a food desert in their area, I\u0026rsquo;m just doing an experiment.\nWe can begin by getting the graph of Los Angeles itself along with its nodes and edges.\nla = \u0026#34;Los Angeles, CA, USA\u0026#34; network_type = \u0026#34;walk\u0026#34; G = ox.graph_from_place(la, network_type=network_type) nodes, edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G) We can also take a look at our data itself.\ngroceries = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;Grocery_Stores_20240102.csv\u0026#39;) LOCATION ACCOUNT # BUSINESS NAME DBA NAME STREET ADDRESS CITY ZIP CODE LOCATION DESCRIPTION MAILING ADDRESS MAILING CITY MAILING ZIP CODE NAICS PRIMARY NAICS DESCRIPTION COUNCIL DISTRICT LOCATION START DATE LOCATION END DATE LOCATION 0 0002754901-0002-3 MOISES CLEMENTE THE REAL SNACK STORE 5526 AVALON BLVD LOS ANGELES 90011-5116 5526 AVALON 90011-5116 nan nan nan 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 9 02/02/2015 nan (33.9922, -118.2651) 1 0002869486-0001-4 LETS WORK ALL INC 7-ELEVEN STORE 39763A 3079 N SAN FERNANDO ROAD LOS ANGELES 90065-1410 3079 SAN FERNANDO 90065-1410 POST OFFICE BOX #219088 DALLAS 75221-9088 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 13 01/01/2016 nan (34.1144, -118.2454) 2 0002870509-0001-8 MAURA CALIXTO VELAZQUEZ VELAZQUEZ MINI MARKET 8504 S BROADWAY LOS ANGELES 90003-3335 8504 BROADWAY 90003-3335 nan nan nan 445100 Grocery stores (including supermarkets \u0026amp; convenience stores without gas) 9 11/19/2015 nan (33.9614, -118.2782) We can go ahead and use the LOCATION column in this data table as our means of getting access to the latitude and longitude positions of each of the grocery stores, but first we need to convert these into tuples for ease of use, as they are currently formatted as strings.\ngrocery_loc = groceries[\u0026#39;LOCATION\u0026#39;] grocery_loc_tup = [] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc)): try: grocery_loc_tup.append(tuple(map(float, grocery_loc[i][1:-1].split(\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;)))) except: pass Then we can find the nearest nodes to each of these grocery stores to estimate the node and osmid they would appear at. This is another limitation to consider.\nxs = [grocery_loc_tup[i][1] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc_tup))] ys = [grocery_loc_tup[i][0] for i in range(0, len(grocery_loc_tup))] ids = ox.nearest_nodes(G, X=xs, Y=ys) Great! Now we have a set of osmids for each of our grocery stores that correspond to points in our initial graph of Los Angeles.\nThe rest of this is effectively just creating an isochrone graph. To do this I followed and adapted Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s method using osmnx. So much of the code that you will see as follows will be his or adjusted from his.\nFirstly though, we want to consider a few features. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this in terms of the walking distance from any particular grocery store and we\u0026rsquo;ll assume that the walking speed of an average person is indeed 4.5 km/hr. We can convert this to meters per minute and add the time it takes to traverse an edge on the graph to each edge:\nmpm = travel_speed * 1000 / 60 for u, v, k, data in G.edges(data=True, keys=True): data[\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;] = data[\u0026#39;length\u0026#39;] / mpm The next thing we will have to consider is trip times, which I\u0026rsquo;m going to consider similar to what was initially done in Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s method, but without a trip distance of 24 minutes considered, because that is quite a while one way. In this sense, we\u0026rsquo;ll consider 5 minutes at minimum and 20 minutes at maximum. We can get colors in the range of some colormap thus, to visualize a range of distances.\ntrip_times = [5, 10, 15, 20] iso_colors = ox.plot.get_colors(n=len(trip_times), cmap=\u0026#39;magma\u0026#39;, start=0, return_hex=True) We can get the colors of each of the individual nodes on the graph of Los Angeles using these iso_colors and by using each of the osmids we found to correlated to each of the groceries at \u0026ldquo;starting points\u0026rdquo;:\nnode_colors = {} for id in ids: for t, c in zip(sorted(trip_times, reverse=True), iso_colors): subgraph = nx.ego_graph(G, id, radius=t, distance=\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;) for node in subgraph.nodes(): node_colors[node] = c And then we can present it all, finally, in a graph, making sure to assign colors where necessary:\nWalking Distance to Grocery Stores in Los Angeles\rHmmmmmm. Evidently a lot of what Open Street Map considers to be Los Angeles is not covered by the data from Los Angeles. Or maybe my code was wrong! I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What I can see is that, of the areas that are covered by colors, a majority of it is within a good walking distance of a grocery store, with the exceptions in brighter areas. I can already notice an amount of problems Id like to come back and resolve, but I\u0026rsquo;m tired, so this will be it for now!\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/bookreviews/hardboiled/","title":"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\r#\rAuthor Haruki MurakamiDate September 21, 2025Rating 5/5\rOddly enough, this might just be my favorite book of Murakami\u0026rsquo;s that I\u0026rsquo;ve read so far. Maybe because the seasons of the book just so happen to align with the current seasons of real life, or maybe because the narrators just felt slightly more understandable than previous ones, but there was something special about it that previous novels of his I\u0026rsquo;ve read haven\u0026rsquo;t caught. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because the translator is a different person than for the last ones I\u0026rsquo;ve read. I think he captures more of the fluidity that I feel gives these two stories more weight. This works in tandem with the differences in distance between the two narratives, and how Birnbaum was able to capture the closeness of \u0026ldquo;The End of The World\u0026rdquo; story in comparison with the other.

Traditional news journalism was read or recieved through newspapers or some other form of once-daily edification. Now we no longer seek this form of keeping up to date with what is going on in the world, rather we tend to find information and news through articles online. Now, rather than articles being selected for users based upon their relevance and importance, these articles and authors need to find a way to make the user more likely to click on and read their writing. Many of these articles have maintained journalistic integrity in keeping with some set of standards, whereas some have tended towards other means of gaining user interest.\nMany make the claim online that some of the articles use strong emotions to make users more interested in the information therein. Either articles can have headlines that are very positive (happy inducing, perhaps) or negative (anger or sadness inducing, maybe).\nBased upon these claims, I was curious to see if I could potentially look at the headlines of many different news agencies and see if I could determine how much emotion was being utilized therein. I found that quite a majority of the articles that I had looked at were still fairly neutral, though there will still many an occasion of strong emotion persent.\nTo analyze emotions in text, I used vader sentiment analysis, and used the compound score it gave for each article (which is on a scale of -1 to 0 to 1, with -1 being the most negative emotionally, and 1 being the most positive emotionally) to create graphs for a number of news agencies on how they have utilized emotions in their headlines over time.\nI was also able to calculate the average compound sentiment score for each news agency. Interestingly, all of them skewed positive. While there were many articles that were both very positive and very negitive from all of the groups, the overall skew was still positive. However, most of the articles in every agency was neutral and very close to a score of 0.\nThere are some very important notes to make about the scores that I have, however, they are not tremendously accurate. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a news agency with three articles, each of which have a compound score of 0. Its average score then is a 0, and this is accurately reflected in its articles. What if it has three articles with scores of -1, 0, and 1? Then the average score would still be 0, but clearly they put out more emotionally charged (and perhaps divisive) articles. This bias, along with a lot more that I probably have not realized or accounted for, are likely to be prevalent in my scores.\nBelow, you will see a table with all of average scores, both compound, positive, and negative scores for each agency.\nAgency Compound Positive Negative The New York Times 0.0261689 0.0192063 0.0046609 Breitbart 0.02408299 0.02090032 0.00665240 CNN 0.03414162 0.02843440 0.00503824 Business Insider 0.06110852 0.03306334 0.00388264 The Atlantic 0.02058144 0.01716854 0.00356693 Fox News 0.04760875 0.03312206 0.00710000 Buzzfeed 0.03076971 0.02058508 0.00535929 The National Review 0.01993751 0.01858704 0.00496947 The New York Post 0.05131073 0.03820476 0.00518698 NPR 0.02992590 0.02032171 0.00449541 Vox 0.04143098 0.02530119 0.00403961 The Washington Post 0.03914736 0.02508142 0.00426336 Talking Points Memo 0.02116882 0.01664933 0.00484788 The Guardian 0.04446168 0.03017346 0.00564048 Reuters 0.05193949 0.03652189 0.00503184 From this table above, one can see that much of the data is fairly neutral in terms of emotion sparked.

It does teach you a lot about the value of certain things that you may not put a lot of value in.

One interesting consideration to have when it comes to playing Monopoly is to consider which squares are landed upon the most. I typically spend my games trying to purchase squares near the end of the board, because if anybody lands on them I get a higher payout, but is that mentality necessarily true?\nAs it turns out, no.\nWe might imagine that as we roll the die, there would be an even spread of chance for landing on any particular square on the board. This would be true if we never had external forces moving us around the board and if we were only following the whim of the die.\nConsider that if we roll doubles thrice, we go to jail, and there are special cards and circumstances that would send us back to the beginning of the board. This leads us to having a skew to the home position and to the jail location. Considering these pieces of information, upon exiting them with another role of the die, we may find a lot of our locations clustered around the following spots on the board.\nKnowing this information, we can then create a Python script that contains knowledge of all of the positions on the board and of all of the chance and community chest cards to effectively play the game some number of times counting up each spot we land on to determine which spots are landed upon the most frequently.\nThe following are the results that I have attained from the code:\nSquare Probability of Landing Jail / Just Visiting 6.7% Go 3.11% Reading Railroad 2.88% Illinois Avenue 2.82% St. Charles Place 2.73% Boardwalk 2.7% Short Line 2.65% New York Avenue 2.6% Water Works 2.54% Tennessee Avenue 2.47% Free Parking 2.45% Community Chest 2.44% Community Chest - 2 2.43% St. James Place 2.39% Electric Company 2.39% Kentucky Avenue 2.39% Chance 2.38% Chance - 2 2.35% Income Tax 2.35% Vermont Avenue 2.35% Pennsylvania Railroad 2.34% Indiana Avenue 2.33% Connecticut Avenue 2.3% Chance - 3 2.29% Oriental Avenue 2.29% B. \u0026amp; O.

Previously, I had attempted to model the metro of Paris, and then perform a shortest path search on two random stations within.\nThis time, I have chosen to target Montreal, and while I had initially wanted to perform greenspace analysis (due to my interest in the Ruelles Vertes), I had quickly found data for air pollution therein. This data looked pretty comprehensive to me (foreshadowing), so I figured that it would be interesting to consider air pollution across Montreal. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;d be able to use some of my osmnx knowledge to plot some information over it to possibly reveal more information.\nI used this dataset from Montreal government\u0026rsquo;s website providing data on the city itself (Montréal Données Ouvertes), which provided historical data on Montreal\u0026rsquo;s air pollution. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin by trying to understand this data.\naq = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;rsqa-indice-qualite-air-2019-2021.csv\u0026#39;) aq.head() stationId polluant valeur date heure 0 17 CO 1 2019-02-19 18 1 17 O3 20 2019-02-19 18 2 17 NO2 3 2019-02-19 18 3 17 PM 9 2019-02-19 18 4 80 SO2 1 2019-02-19 18 stationId refers to the id of the station in which the measurement was taken at.\npolluant refers to the pollutant the measure refers to.\nvaleur is the quantified amount of the pollutant. According to Montreal\u0026rsquo;s data page, the data ranges as follows:\n1-25 : Good 26-50 : Acceptable 50 \u003e : Bad date is the date the measurement was taken.\nheure is the hour the measurement was taken, in 24h.\nAt first, I was unaware of what the stationId exactly refers to. However, after look around Montréal Données Ouvertes a bit more, I managed to find another useful dataset that would explain this better:\nstations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations.head() numero_station SNPA statut nom adresse arrondissement_ville latitude longitude X Y secteur_id secteur_nom hauteur 0 1 50102 fermé Jardin Botanique Jardin Botanique, Montréal Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie 45.5622 -73.5718 299196 5.04692e+06 1 Centre-Ville 4 1 3 50103 ouvert Saint-Jean-Baptiste 1050 A, St-Jean-Baptiste Rivière-des-Prairies 45.641 -73.4997 304825 5.05568e+06 4 Est 4 2 6 50124 ouvert Anjou 7650 rue Châteauneuf Anjou 45.6028 -73.5589 300207 5.05144e+06 4 Est 12 This has been shortened further for the sake of length\nHere, we can see that the numero_station would relate to our stationId, and thus now we know it correlates to a particular station somewhere in Montreal where the data was obtained or calculated. So, for example, the station with stationId=17 was found to be Caserne 17 at 4240 rue Charleroi.\nNow that our data has been established and related, we need a way to project it onto an actual map of Montreal. In this case, I will be used geopandas and a shapefile of Montreal, which just outlines the shape of a geographic area that we can graph and project information onto:\nimport geopandas as gpd import pandas as pd from shapely.geometry import Point from matplotlib.colors import TwoSlopeNorm montreal_shape = gpd.read_file(\u0026#39;montreal_shapefile.geojson\u0026#39;) fig,ax = plt.subplots() montreal_shape.plot(ax=ax) stations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations_latlong = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(stations[\u0026#39;longitude\u0026#39;], stations[\u0026#39;latitude\u0026#39;])] montreal_stations_geo = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=stations_latlong) montreal_stations_geo.plot(ax=ax, markersize=20, color=\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) Projection of station locations onto Montreal\rUnfortunately, for some reason, projecting the locations of the stations onto the map itself seems to distort it a bit? We\u0026rsquo;ll deal with that in our final projection and display later.\nDoubly unfortunately, these stations are clustered in a particular subset of the arrondissements of Montreal. This means that we will not get at all a very fully defined graph, but one that will rather have information based upon a particular subset of the arrondissements. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have an idea of how to deal with this, so I\u0026rsquo;ll let it live, at least for now.\nOtherwise, the data is historic over a few years and over many days, so, we will first perform some aggregate computation on the amount of pollution per pollutant per station in the city:\naq = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;rsqa-indice-qualite-air-2019-2021.csv\u0026#39;) aq_stations = aq[\u0026#39;stationId\u0026#39;].unique() aq_poll_types = aq[\u0026#39;polluant\u0026#39;].unique() avg_res_lst = [] for t in aq_poll_types: avg_res = {} aq_t = aq[aq[\u0026#39;polluant\u0026#39;] == t] for s in aq_stations: all_val = aq_t[aq_t[\u0026#39;stationId\u0026#39;] == s] if len(all_val) \u0026gt; 0: avg_val = sum(all_val[\u0026#39;valeur\u0026#39;]) / len(all_val[\u0026#39;valeur\u0026#39;]) avg_res[s] = avg_val avg_res_lst.append(avg_res) stations = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;liste-des-stations-rsqa.csv\u0026#39;) stations = stations.set_index(\u0026#39;numero_station\u0026#39;) for i in range(0, len(aq_poll_types)): stations[aq_poll_types[i]] = avg_res_lst[i] stations.head() numero_station SNPA statut nom adresse arrondissement_ville latitude longitude X Y secteur_id secteur_nom hauteur CO O3 NO2 PM SO2 1 50102 fermé Jardin Botanique Jardin Botanique, Montréal Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie 45.5622 -73.5718 299196 5.04692e+06 1 Centre-Ville 4 nan nan nan nan nan 3 50103 ouvert Saint-Jean-Baptiste 1050 A, St-Jean-Baptiste Rivière-des-Prairies 45.641 -73.4997 304825 5.05568e+06 4 Est 4 nan 15.7134 2.27282 11.279 1.29435 6 50124 ouvert Anjou 7650 rue Châteauneuf Anjou 45.6028 -73.5589 300207 5.05144e+06 4 Est 12 nan 14.1824 2.89384 11.4153 0.992231 This table has been shortened for the sake of length\nHmm, I don\u0026rsquo;t like how a lot of the stations lack air pollution data.

The above code shows the example for just one of the plots, the rest follow the same methadology, just changing the particular pollutant.\nAir Pollution in Montreal by Pollutant Type\rYeah, a lot of unknown data there. Interestingly, pollution of PM (particular matter) appears to be the worst here, whereas the rest of the pollution isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad at all, at least as far as I can tell. Everything here appears to fall witin the 1-25 range anyhow, which is defined by the city of Montreal as the range for air pollution to be at a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; level.\nHmm, now we can consider the osmnx factor. Particularly, I want to see which areas in Montreal are zoned for industral landuse, and then project that onto the air pollution. First, let\u0026rsquo;s display the areas zoned for industrial use:\nmontreal = \u0026#34;Montreal, Quebec, Canada\u0026#34; area = ox.geocode_to_gdf(montreal) constr_tags = {\u0026#39;landuse\u0026#39;:[\u0026#39;industrial\u0026#39;]} parks = ox.features_from_place(montreal, constr_tags) fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6)) area.plot(ax=ax, facecolor=\u0026#39;white\u0026#39;, zorder=0) edges.plot(ax=ax, linewidth=0.5, edgecolor=\u0026#39;dimgrey\u0026#39;, zorder=1) parks.plot(ax=ax, color=\u0026#39;#fa7474\u0026#39;, alpha=0.7, markersize=10, zorder=3) plt.axis(\u0026#39;off\u0026#39;) Industrial Zoning in Montreal\rAnd now that we have that! We can just overlay the industrial zoning parts onto one of our geopandas graphs from earlier. In this case, I\u0026rsquo;ll just settle on the one that shows the particulate matter pollution as that was the most prevalent one:\nParticular Matter Air Pollution vs. Industrial Zoning in Montreal\rAnd there we are! We can see that there is a reasonable amount of areas zoned for industrial use in the city, and we can relate that to areas of air pollution. This would be a lot nicer if we had more rich data on the air pollution in the particular arrondissements of Montreal, but I think this is reasonable as a teaching tool, at least for me.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/bookreviews/murder_in_the_cathedral/","title":"Murder in the Cathedral","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rMurder in the Cathedral\r#\rT.S.

It is always a joy to read Christie and especially her stories with Poirot, and this is no exception.\nOne thing I would mention that is a bit out of the ordinary from the detective fiction I\u0026rsquo;ve read is the way this novel is set up. It isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily set up in the same vein as other detective fiction, but is rather broken down into a few sections: the case itself, meeting the passengers/dealing with evidence, and the ending. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen both the film adaptations of this novel, so actually reading it in this format (and with this set up) was rather interesting, though it does make sense from a deductive standpoint, I reckon.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this novel as I got great enjoyment out of it, but I do understand that the set up/progression of the novel could be a bit off putting to some.\n"},{"id":38,"href":"/bookreviews/neverwhere/","title":"Neverwhere","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rNeverwhere\r#\rNeil Gaiman\r#\rJuly 30, 2023\n5/5\nI have not read very many fantasy novels in my lifetime.

Sure, I have read a fair bit of poetry since then, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t really taken the time to analyze it like I used to.\nOverall, this book was enjoyable. There were certainly poems I enjoyed, and the book did introduce me to Rainer Maria Rilke\u0026rsquo;s work, which I will certainly have to read more in the future, but there were also poems I just read for the sake of completion. While poems are certainly quite subjective, and I understand that my tastes may not match everyone else\u0026rsquo;s, I am still not a fan of having to churn through writing. Still though, of the poems I enjoyed, they were fantastically descriptive and lovely to read. I imagine that on a second read through of this book, I will feel more kindly to it (this isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that I hate it now - I don\u0026rsquo;t, I did enjoy it).\nOn the plus side, this is a book of poems, each one isn\u0026rsquo;t related to the other like a story (of course), so you can skip the one\u0026rsquo;s you do not like. You can read it at your leisure or at a very slow pace, even more so than with other books.\nI imagine that the best case reading scenario of this book would be to read it while on vacation in Rome. I googled many of the locations listed so I could understand what they looked like as I read it, but I imagine that reading each poem in their listed location would be far more gratifying than reading it in bed, like I did.\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes Rome (or is currently in Rome, be it living there or just visiting), maybe they have never been or perhaps they just want to visit it on a night in at home, or to anybody who is interested in Roman history, and would like to go more into depth in the literary history of it.\n"},{"id":44,"href":"/literature/realprogrammersusegmail/","title":"Real Programmers Use Gmail","section":"Literature","content":"\rReal Programmers Use Gmail\r#\rI was recently having a conversation with a good friend of mine from the university.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know a lot about the story beforehand (besides whatever is in the public consciousness), and it\u0026rsquo;d taken me long enough to get round to the book, so I dived right on it.\nSome slight spoilers ahead.\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. The main downside I found in the book was the unbelievableness in some aspects of the story, like how excessively quickly Romeo and Juliet decided they loved each other, and things along those lines. I figured, after reading such things as that, that I would find the book unfavorable, mostly in how quickly an attempt was made to push the two together, but I found that Shakespeare did it fantastically and made the whole idea seem reasonable.\nMany facets of the book were absolutely lovely to read. Going in, I was sure that I would have trouble understanding what was going on, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad at all, the writing and speech do become rather melodic. The famous scenes of when Romeo first meets Juliet and when he speaks to her from her window were absolutely fantastic example of how nice the speech was to read. Their individual lines flowing from one character to another was done with such cleanliness that I genuinely felt the need to read it out loud, so as to get a better experience of the writing.\nI highly recommend this book to pretty much any reader. There is a reason it is so famous and it is an absolute delight to read.

This lends itself to intrigue of course, but the book did have some ingenuity to itself.

Now, I often find that people need the characters in a book to be good for the book to be good, where they describe a bad person as poorly written, because they are a bad person, not because the author developed them well. This book fully explains Hajime\u0026rsquo;s actions and explains how he comes to do what he does, that does not make Hajime a good person, certainly, but that is not good justification for arguing that this book is bad.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s quite surprising to see Murakami bring an audience to understand a person\u0026rsquo;s actions, even though while we read through the book we completely feel that they are a bad person. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly interesting.\nTo some degree, I feel that the book feels almost like a what if for looking back on first loves or crushes, by taking it to the present and making it go in seemingly the best way (the best way when one succumbs to one\u0026rsquo;s thoughts in an unhealthy way). The sort of havoc this continuous looking back wreaks upon oneself.\nEven reading Hajime explain himself and his thoughts at the end, I do feel quite irritated with him, because it feels like he both does and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to change, and it solely relates to the comings and goings of the world around him (or the comings and goings of one person in particular).\nDoes it even matter if Shimamoto is real in the end at all? The actions certainly felt real, and the damage and pain he caused were real.

Sometimes when looking at stock data, or when visualizing it, we may want to smooth out the data so that we can avoid shifted perceptions due to temporary changes in stock valuation. This may offer us a more comprehensive look at our data, that is not skewed by any minor blip.\nWe can change the duration of the rolling average, based upon how much smoothing we may want. For example, we could have a shorter smoothing of just 20 days, or longer smoothing of 100 days.\nBefore I did that, though, I first had to reindex my data. Because financial data is collected on weekdays, I had to account for that fact by adding in all of the non-included days in our data between the start and end dates we provided. We can fill these empty spots in with na and then we can reindex those to copy the previously entered piece of data into that box.\nimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt close = panel_data[\u0026#39;Close\u0026#39;] all_weekdays = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq=\u0026#39;B\u0026#39;) close = close.reindex(all_weekdays) close = close.fillna(method=\u0026#39;ffill\u0026#39;) short_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=20).mean() long_rolling_msft = close.rolling(window=100).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days rolling\u0026#39;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() When developing a stock strategy, or trading strategy, we will want to analyze the change in the returns of our stock over time. One way to do this would be to look at relative returns. A relative return is the amount of return our stock will get after some timeline relative to some benchmark return. The formula for relative returns looks as follows.\n\\[\rr_{relative}(t) = \\frac{p(t) - p(t - 1)}{p(t - 1)}\r\\]\rAnother way to do this would be through logarithmic returns, the formula which is as follows.\n\\[\rr(t) = log(\\frac{p(t)}{p(t - 1)})\r\\]\rThere are many reasons why we may wish to use a log return, rather than relative returns, some of which would be that they capture the compounding effect. When we consider that financial investments such as these are compounded over many points in time, we may find this compounding important to capture in our data, which make log returns more appealing in their use.\nimport numpy as np log_returns = np.log(close).diff() fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(16, 12)) ax1.plot(log_returns.index, log_returns.cumsum(), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax1.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Cumulative log returns\u0026#39;) ax1.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax1.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) ax2.plot(log_returns.index, 100*(np.exp(log_returns.cumsum()) - 1), label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax2.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Total relative returns (%)\u0026#39;) ax2.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax2.legend(loc=\u0026#39;upper left\u0026#39;) plt.show() While analyzing our data visually is indeed very useful, it is also helpful to analyze our data quantitatively.

This method is evidently fairly easy to create, and shows us the general trend of our stock movement. Another method is known as the \u0026ldquo;exponential moving average\u0026rdquo; (EMA). This method of moving average places more importance/weight on more recent data points, so it accounts more strongly for recent changes in price.\nWith the EMA, we can also do it across a time period, perhaps 20 or even 100 days. Below I have graphed the regular stock price and both the EMA and SMA across 20 and 100 days, so as to easily see their differences.\nema_short = close.ewm(span = 20, adjust=False).mean() ema_long = close.ewm(span = 100, adjust=False).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(ema_short.index, ema_short, label=\u0026#34;20 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.plot(ema_long.index, ema_long, label=\u0026#34;100 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() Before making any investment it is critical to know the volatility of a stock, as it can give us insight into how risky the stock may be as an investment. Volatility measures how dispersed, or spread out, the returns for our stock is. Thus, the greater the volatility is, the riskier of an investment it would be. It can be calculated as the standard deviation between returns of the stock. Below you can see the measured stock volatility based upon the log returns of the stock price and its frequency.\nema_short = close.ewm(span = 20, adjust=False).mean() ema_long = close.ewm(span = 100, adjust=False).mean() fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,9)) ax.plot(close.index, close, label=\u0026#39;AAPL\u0026#39;) ax.plot(short_rolling_msft.index, short_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;20 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(long_rolling_msft.index, long_rolling_msft, label=\u0026#39;100 days SMA\u0026#39;) ax.plot(ema_short.index, ema_short, label=\u0026#34;20 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.plot(ema_long.index, ema_long, label=\u0026#34;100 days EMA\u0026#34;) ax.set_xlabel(\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) ax.set_ylabel(\u0026#39;Adjusted closing price ($)\u0026#39;) ax.legend() There is a lot more analysis that can and should be done to better understand investments, in this case stock investments, so I intend to come back to this topic in the future to learn about more methods for financial analysis.\n"},{"id":52,"href":"/bookreviews/stoner/","title":"Stoner","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rStoner\r#\rJohn Williams\r#\rJune 19, 2023\n5/5\nThis book was a rather quick read compared to what I\u0026rsquo;m used to.

I happened to find the blurb on the book really interesting, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find much about it online, outside of some book reviews. Which immediately made me interested.\nThe book is rather not that long, and many of the \u0026ldquo;chapters\u0026rdquo; are less than a page long. I say \u0026ldquo;chapter\u0026rdquo;, because the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have chapters in its normal sense, in fact, they are rather more like broken up processes of thought or a change in viewpoints.\nThe prose is wonderful, and I frequently found myself very comforted by the way that Énard writes. It is a form of writing that I cannot describe, or truly give any life to, but it was fantastic. To me, it really captured a sense of calm and peace, which when mixed with the setting of Constantinople, really made me feel at home. I have not felt this relaxed when reading a novel in a long time.\n(Potential spoilers ahead.) The only downside to this book in my mind is the ending, which I found to be a bit sudden, unexpected, and blocky. It may be perfectly acceptable to some, but I found it a bit too jarring when compared to the rest of the book.\nOverall, I found this to be an absolutely fantastic and lovely book, with a few chips in the glaze. I would recommend this strongly to anybody who wants a calming, relaxing book that is quite thoughtful nonetheless. I look forward to reading more from Mathias Énard in the future!\n"},{"id":54,"href":"/bookreviews/thecountofmontecristo/","title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Count of Monte Cristo\r#\rAlexandre Dumas\r#\rAugust 5, 2021\n5/5\nFor a while now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been continuously hearing people rave about this book, describing it as thrilling and exciting. And that\u0026rsquo;s coming from people who aren\u0026rsquo;t even that into classical literature as some others may be. After finishing the book, I can certainly agree with that sentiment.\nWithout laying too much on the line, this book deals a lot with vengeance, and slow, critically aimed vengeance at that, which left me continuously wanting to see what would happen next. This point in it self is enough to satisfy thriller enthusiasts, but to even those that prefer more thought provoking stories, I would say this book is up to par still.\nWith books like these, I don\u0026rsquo;t just. want an exciting rush through a story , but I do want something I can perhaps also put some contemplation, or thinking, into, and this book has also satiated that desire. Though much of the book is thrilleresque and speedy, there are certainly some moments that lead me to slow down a bit and consider our hero\u0026rsquo;s situation and the situation of others. There were also a lot of moments that would lead me to consider what could cause me to \u0026ldquo;break\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;go bad\u0026rdquo; for personal gain. in a sense.\nWith the way this book is set up, I think that almost anyone could get into the story, from classical purists to those that adore YA.\nOverall, this book is an exciting yet contemplative story that I would recommend almost anyone to read, and I daresay that I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll like it!.\n"},{"id":55,"href":"/bookreviews/theeleganceofthehedgehog/","title":"The Elegance of the Hedgehog","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Elegance of the Hedgehog\r#\rMuriel Barbery\r#\rAugust 19, 2022\n1.5/5\nThere are many reasons why this book is not enjoyable, and many folks have already given many reasons to that effect, but for me it was mostly the characters and one passage in particular (which gave me reason to doubt a lot of the book).\nFirstly, the characters are not great. One is a concierge named Renee, who does not wish for the rich people living in the building she works at to discover she has read a couple Dostoevskys and understands some Wikipedia articles on philosophy. She believes that she needs to present herself as ignorant and stupid, so that nobody inquires into her. This genuinely makes no sense to me (even when the reason for her actions are explained later in the book). I cannot comprehend how anybody would think that other people would care for the fact that you can read. No rich person gives two hoots of a whistle that you have read big books in the past, and the fact that the character genuinely believes that this information could ruin her life is ridiculous.\nThe other character is a young girl named Paloma, who lives in the same building and wants to kill herself and burn down the building. Fantastic. She is also supposedly quite smart and spends the entire book trying to find a meaning to live on. She also feels the need to hide her intelligence from her family (and her sister in particular), again for no reason really.\nI can understand that irritating characters don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a book bad, but these two people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any logical reasoning behind their actions, which frustrated me to no end throughout my reading.\nSecondly, there is a passage in the book that goes as follows:\n\u0026ldquo;When we Westerners walk, our culture dictates that we must, through the continuity of a movement we envision as smooth and seamless, try to restore what we take to be the very essence of life: efficiency without obstacles, a fluid performance that, being free of interruption, will represent the vital élan thanks to which all will be realized. For us the standard is the cheetah in action: all his movements fuse together harmoniously, one cannot be distinguished from the next, and the swift passage of the great wild animal seems like one long continuous movement symbolizing the deep perfection of life. When a J apanese woman disrupts the powerful sequence of natural movement with her jerky little steps, we ought to experience the disquiet that troubles our soul whenever nature is violated in this way, but in fact we are filled with a unfamiliar blissfulness, as if disruption could lead to a sort of ecstasy, and a grain of sand to beauty. What we discover in this affront to the sacred rhythm of life, this defiant movement of little feet, this excellence born of constraint, is a paradigm of Art.\u0026rdquo;\nNow a lot of this book touches on psychology and philosophy, things that I find interesting, but really don\u0026rsquo;t understand or have any fundamental knowledge in. But this passage did tread on some knowledge that I do have, walking (as it feels adjacent to flaneur). Given that, this entire passage made genuinely no sense to me, and did not logically connect.\nFirstly, the passage begins by attacking the western mode of walking, apparently we all walk \u0026ldquo;smooth and seamless\u0026rdquo;, because we all want to be efficient and fast. That is patently ridiculous. The flaneur (the very antithesis to this form of walking attributed to westerners) was born in the west, and in Paris for that matter! The very city this book takes place in. Also this is conflating all westerners together. You can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that someone from Waco, Texas walks the same as someone from New York City or someone from London.\nWhile this seems like something really stupid to complain about, this very discussion of walking appears to me to be a way that the author wants to critique western life (or modern western life), in that through our mode of walking, one can determine that we are all people that want efficiency, smoothness, and speed in our lives. This is, of course, false. Barbery appears to imagine that all westerners work at places like Wall Street and continuously name drop \u0026ldquo;the grindset\u0026rdquo; whilst chugging a Starbucks latte.\nThis form of walking is then juxtaposed with the Japanese form, which she describes as \u0026ldquo;jerky\u0026rdquo;, and is thus an \u0026ldquo;affront to the sacred rhythm of life\u0026rdquo;, because it isn\u0026rsquo;t smooth or fast. That also sounds absurd and over generalizes Japan the same way it did with the west previously. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that businessmen in Tokyo may fit the author\u0026rsquo;s previous complaint on western walking, while someone in a smaller town would not. This phase of the passage was also incredibly uncomfortable to read, at least for me.\nThis may not seem like a lot, and perhaps I am making a mountain out of a mole hill, but what it revealed to me is that on a single passage in which I had some very minimal knowledge on the background discussion, I could notice countless flaws that made the passage make no sense to me. That made me wonder how many more errors of this kind were present in the mass bulk of the novel, especially in areas I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand? Probably a lot, and reading some of the other reviews, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be too far off in that thought.\nOverall, this book was not very good. I went into the book thinking that, and it was reaffirmed, but I did have some fun with how ridiculous some passages and thoughts were.\nI can understand why some people may like this book, it is interesting in some regards, and the ending was better then the beginning and middle, so all I can suggest is to maybe read this.\nThanks!\n"},{"id":56,"href":"/bookreviews/theforest/","title":"The Forest","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Forest\r#\rEdward Rutherfurd\r#\rFebruary 16, 2023\n4.5/5\nI have only read one other novel by Edward Rutherford, \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo;, which has become one of my favorite books and one that I go back to reasonably often. I bought this book quite a long while ago, but didn\u0026rsquo;t finish it the first time around, giving it another shot though was absolutely a great idea.\nThis book was an incredibly engaging historical sequence and story of a couple different old families of the New Forest region in southern England. Unlike \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo;, which quite often jumped back and forth in time and between stories of families, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; went through each time period chapter by chapter, causing a more fluid story in some sense. One other interesting difference was how \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo; appeared to have a primary story/timeline one followed (late 1800s to the early 1900s), however, \u0026ldquo;The Forest\u0026rdquo; does not have this. Each time period is important and engaging in its own way, and each former time period would be recalled and regaled in later chapters in some way.\nThe one common downside of Edward Rutherford books is that there are very often phases of the story that feel incredibly clunky, which is in part due to the massive amounts of factual information being provided. If I recall correctly, in the first chapter, there was a few page long discussion of trees in the New Forest, and while it was certainly interesting, it felt a little bit out of place compared to the story that was just taking place. In this sense, the fact delivery nature of the novels can be clunky, but really I\u0026rsquo;ve read no other author\u0026rsquo;s work that can handle it very smoothly. In some sense, it feels like a hazard of the trade.\nEach chapter was very engaging and fun, and I often felt sad at leaving the characters I had finally grown accustomed to in the last chapter to sally forth and read about their descendants. I highly recommend this book both for its story and its historical delivery.\n"},{"id":57,"href":"/bookreviews/the_grip_of_film/","title":"The Grip of Film","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Grip of Film\r#\rRichard Aoyade\r#\rOctober 2, 2023\n4/5\nThis is a pretty good book.

As the book went on though, I found the jokes to be gradually less funny, but I think that is partly due to the fact that the entire book is effectively full of jokes all of the same type and style. Some may really love this, but others may find it more tedious.\nIn this way, I gradually just started looking forward to the end of the novel, but I still think it was worthwhile, and definitely a pretty good book.\n"},{"id":58,"href":"/bookreviews/the_hound_of_the_baskervilles/","title":"The Hound of The Baskervilles","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Hound of The Baskervilles\r#\rArthur Conan Doyle\r#\rJune 27, 2024\n5/5\nExcellent, of course.

I was first aware of it through a series that Tom Scott put out a while ago titled \u0026ldquo;How to Becomes Famous on the Internet\u0026rdquo;. In the third and last video, he brought up the central action of this book and discussed a book by the KLF called \u0026ldquo;The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)\u0026rdquo;, and for some reason that I can\u0026rsquo;t fully remember, that put me down the path to finding this book. Again much later, this book came up through the Shakespeare and Co. podcast, with the author discussing the 90s in great depth. These occurrences from these specific areas were more than enough for me to come to read this book.\nI recommend this book.\n"},{"id":61,"href":"/bookreviews/the_learners/","title":"The Learners","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Learners\r#\rChip Kidd\r#\rJanuary 1, 2024\n5/5\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t actually heard of Chip Kidd until I started reading this book, and for some strange reason, I began this book thinking it was an autobiography.

In another sense, though, this book questions the innate sense of or sentiment of humanity, at our core selves.\nThe pivot that occurs in this book, and the direction it began to take, I think was perfectly pointed in this book and came just at the right time. For both the book and myself.\nIt does pose a lot of questions about our innate behavior, and I do wonder more as a consequence of it.

This book is a bit more of a quicker read compared to some of the others that I\u0026rsquo;ve read, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably due to the subject matter, and the speed with which I read mystery novels.\nThere were a few gripes I do have with the novel, two in fact. Firstly, a lot of the intrigue happens a bit late in the book, so I found myself reading somewhat slowly for the first two thirds of the book, and the speeding it and the last mark.

Perhaps that is just because life has changed since I last read it.

The first half took a good few weeks, but the second half was finished rather quickly.\nI recall reading something in the preface/note that mentioned that Henchard was not a bad man, but that he is hot-tempered. It was hard, for much of the novel, for me to understand why that statement was true, why it was the case, but I seemed to then have forgotten something I recall now, that people can change. This novel is the greatest example of the complexity of humans that I have thus far read. This book is very effective in showing that we are not 1 dimensional beings with a set of non-malleable characteristics.\nThe full title of this novel, \u0026ldquo;The Mayor of Casterbridge: A Story of a Man of Character\u0026rdquo;, really fits the theme of the story. What does it mean \u0026ldquo;to have character\u0026rdquo;? I\u0026rsquo;ve done some quick Googling, but have gotten many different answers: moral excellence and firmness or being able to deal well with difficult situations. However, the best definitions, to me at least, discuss individuality, and how \u0026ldquo;character\u0026rdquo; just means the sum of our traits. This means that you can have good character or bad character, they can all fall under the same label, at least I suppose so (I\u0026rsquo;m not a linguist, nor am I good at English).\nTo describe Henchard as a \u0026ldquo;man of character\u0026rdquo; is fitting to me, though with the definition I have given, it fits all of us wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it? I like how ambiguous this phrase is, though. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell us much, then, about Henchard, but effectively that he is just a person, like any of us. In that way, I guess we can all perhaps see at least some of ourselves in Henchard (or maybe I just have problems that need to be resolved).\nForgive me for these poorly written ramblings. I have no qualifications in reading or writing, I just enjoy thinking about it.\nThe book is fantastic, and if you want to read a story with characters that are just as complex, confusing, and contrary to their own nature as real people are, then I would give this novel a read.

I can\u0026rsquo;t say why I felt he made more sense in the second half, though. To some degree, he felt happier (for a short period of time) and it seemed like he had more emotions. Certainly that was true in the final few chapters, where it becomes clear that he has lost his freedom, which I surmise is just about when he also figured out what freedom means (at least to his purview). These emotions maybe had given me some level of empathy towards him, even with the murder.\nI fear that me not being able to understand Meursault at the beginning of this book, or at least not being able to emphasize to some degree, makes me the same as all the people in the court who could not comprehend him either. Certainly, I feel the reason he has lost his freedom and put to death is a poor one (not being sad enough for an unrelated incident), but might I also mis-comprehend someone so as to result in a conclusion that is also drastically irrelevant? Maybe that lack of sadness is just a convention, and to that same degree so too would be my convictions towards people who have peeved me.\nCamus, here, is probably giving reason to how our societal expectations (or societal queues) really have no necessary meaning to them. There\u0026rsquo;s no meaningful connection here between Mersault\u0026rsquo;s lack of sadness and him killing a man, but there was a societal expectation that he broke, a societal expectation so fundamental it paints him in such a light so as to make any level of guilt easily thrown towards him.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not the best at reading philosophy, so apologies on the very rusty two cents here. Regardless, I really liked this book, even if I read it in French. Hopefully, one day or another, I will revisit it in English!\n"},{"id":74,"href":"/bookreviews/the_way_to_the_spring/","title":"The Way to the Spring","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rThe Way to the Spring\r#\rAuthor Ben Ehrenreic\rDate January 5, 2025\rRating 5/5\r"},{"id":75,"href":"/bookreviews/true_style/","title":"True Style","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rTrue Style: The History and Principles of Classic Menswear\r#\rG.

It is more of a discussion of fashion and clothing with certain suggestions and offerings, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a guide on how to dress. (There is no proper guide on how to dress).\nI think there are two worlds of menswear, the Gentleman\u0026rsquo;s Gazette side and the Derek Guy side, I clearly prefer the Derek Guy side, it\u0026rsquo;s much friendlier and far more fun.

However, this novel certainly is still very impactful, relevant, and important regardless of whether one can or can\u0026rsquo;t experience the satirical elements throughout.\nI would recommend that one read this book, I found it quite good, and it really is a fascinating read, experiencing another\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint of the world. Asking a person, especially one so educated as Sir Thomas Moore, about what they would see a perfect world to be down to the distribution of food, is interesting, and can paint a great image of the world that the author lived in at the time.\nBased on that, I think that anybody who wants to learn more about politics (the history of politics in particular I\u0026rsquo;d guess) may find this book quite interesting.\nThanks for reading!\n"},{"id":78,"href":"/bookreviews/victory/","title":"Victory","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rVictory\r#\rJoseph Conrad\r#\rDecember 21, 2022\n3/5\nThis book took me a long time to read, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t its fault, though, more of mine.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say the book was pretty good, albeit a little bit slow for my tastes throughout much of the beginning and middle of the book.\nThe ending was absolutely fantastic and when a lot of the writing really came through and shone for me.\nThe setting and description of place that highlighted certain scenes and acts in the story were done fantastically, and did help me lose myself in the plot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, I reckon I should read it again sometime in the future.\n"},{"id":79,"href":"/bookreviews/watch_us_dance/","title":"Watch Us Dance","section":"Book Reviews","content":"\rWatch Us Dance\r#\rLeila Slimani\r#\rOctober 22, 2024\n4/5\nThis is a really interesting book, though a lot of my interest in this book is based on circumspantial interest.\nI first learned about this book through The Shakespeare and Company Podcast, where the author had come to the bookstore to talk about the book and related interests. This particular episode of the podcast has been probably one of the most interesting ones that they had put out, at least from my listening history, though I hadn\u0026rsquo;t decided to go on and read the novel until I listened to it again a few months ago.\nPotential spoilers ahead\nI think going in with the extra information I had about the novel played to its benifit. So to did knowing about May 1968 in Paris and also knowing some other information about student life and the ideals of being young in France at the time. Of course, this is noted both in the podcast episode and in the book (I found it very amusing when Jacques Brel was mentioned). I also knew a bit about the fringes of American life in the late 60s and 70s, which plays into this book as well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s particularly interesting: a lot of the book feels incredibly French, like unavoidably so. Everybody wants to distinguish themselves as different but end up doing much the same as the French youth. But is it even \u0026ldquo;French\u0026rdquo;? I could probably replace that with America and its meaning might still be somewhat the same (though America did not colonize Morocco). It also feels like the previous generation. Everybody wants to distinguish their generation as being the unique bearmarker to which following generations will see and recognize the major earth-shattering changes that shall take place. But so too does each generation end up doing much the same as the past. Is each generation, at least the standard bearers of each generation, they who want to make great change to the world in the name of progress, is the experience of all these standard bearers and all the people who have hope universal? Is their perspectives on the past (be it the France, America, and older generation) purely frustration? Or is there some masked admiration?\nIn hindsight the optimism of the youth may seem absurd. Though maybe I only find it absurd because I don\u0026rsquo;t know many people who feel triumphal about the future. Ironically enough, that same feeling is very normal too, and is represented across all generations. Every generation has the ego to think it the last one.\nRead the book!\n"},{"id":80,"href":"/docs/aboutme/","title":"About Me","section":"Docs","content":"Hello, my name is Arsh Siddiqui.\nThis website contains a portfolio of my writing.\nHopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it\u0026hellip;\nThanks for coming along!\n"},{"id":81,"href":"/google618f010c7db99b61/","title":"Google618f010c7db99b61","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"google-site-verification: google618f010c7db99b61.html"},{"id":82,"href":"/blog/","title":"Blog","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rBlog\r#\rMy thoughts on the most random and unconnected of things.

It’s like, after ten years of challenging social norms, somehow people got into dressing super heteronormative. It was like whiplash: one moment, people are challenging all of these norms, and the next, they’re celebrating Old Money lifestyles and Wall Street greed.\u0026rdquo;\n-Derek Guy\nPreppy fashion I do recommend you listen to the podcast! It is really really good. (It originated from 99pi.) Before anything else, I should say that he was right. This article came out in 2022, and we saw a resurgence in old money (notably, it was as a trend) due in part to shows like Succession and maybe some level of reverence towards a WASP (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) lifestyle.\nNote to you: I know nothing about Succession, but fashion content creators have shoved the clothing of the show and analysis of its cultural impact down my throat. This is all old news, of course, I had known about this to some degree for a while and I had known about some of the criticisms leveled at it. For one, a lot of the people used this infatuation with WASPiness and \u0026ldquo;old money\u0026rdquo; as a cudgel against \u0026ldquo;new money\u0026rdquo;. To me this felt like a rebranding of upper crust and people identifying with their social majority attacking what they considered \u0026ldquo;vulgar\u0026rdquo;, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a big fan of that. Effectively, it seemed like people were criticizing \u0026ldquo;new money\u0026rdquo; for gaudily showing off their money through sports cars and streetwear, instead of showing off their money through Victorian mansions built next to plantations.\nNot literally of course, they were more obsessed with the idea of elegant clothing, sophistication, fancy alcohol, tennis sweaters, and so on. I know these folks aren't literally advocating for a wealth that had directly arisen from slavery, racism, and/or colonialism. Rather, they just want to promote an aesthetic sans the history surrounding it. My primary concern is that the abject criticism of \"new wealth\" by some proponents of \"old money\" felt a bit icky, at least to me. This is just Ralph Lauren, but it's a good example of the old money aesthetic I had first come across the aesthetic and criticisms thanks to this video by Mina Le, which was really interesting. A lot of my original thoughts on this subject are based around her summarization and analysis of the aesthetic. The primary thing I can think to add to it is that the past movement towards these \u0026ldquo;elite\u0026rdquo; aesthetics struck me as a reaction against fashion trends before it, primarily streetwear. Interestingly, streetwear itself is a reaction against heteronormativity, and thus \u0026ldquo;old money\u0026rdquo; is a reaction against a reaction against heteronormativity.\nIn some way, that feels like a tale as old as time doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Reacting against the normative culture, and then reacting against a non-normative culture (how do you think millenials felt about oversized clothing when they were younger? Slim was punk!). I wonder then if anything I just mentioned is worth discussing, because sometimes it feels like everything (not just fashion!) is cyclical. It just happens to be easier for me to see this cyclical-ness through fashion as opposed to other forms of art.\nI am probably partly reflecting on this because a lot of this felt very familiar to what I had read in the novel, \"Watch Us Dance\", just that was more political\nThis brings us to today (or today-ish I suppose), where an aesthetic based upon corporate fashions is en vogue. How amusing and I suppose this, or something similar to it, should have been expected. It is similar to prep and even old money in its distinctive heteronormativity, at least when compared to the generally more popular world of streetwear. Streetwear, I would at least claim, is probably the defining fashion movement of the last 10-20 years, and even though we now tend to be focused on micro-trends, most of them incorporate some form of streetwear (blokette is the first that comes to mind).\nThen I suppose in that way we have been reacting against streetwear a lot lately, but in a variety of different styles. I can\u0026rsquo;t claim how successful old money might have been as an aesthetic, but I know it reached fashion-unaware people I knew in real life, so it seemed to have had some sort of effect. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not like I see or hear much about it today, though maybe it is something like dark academia, which still has its own little circle but is not in wider conversations about fashion.\nI could be wrong here, so take this statement with a grain of salt, I just don't happen to fly in any fashion circles where dark academia is considered.\nIn this sense, I believe that corp-core could also be considered a reaction against streetwear, though I have heard other interesting analyses of it (Mina Le claimed that corp-core might be a reaction towards the shakines of having and maintaining a job in the current age). The question then arises if this reaction sticks, and if people will genuinely move away from streetwear at a societal level.\nCorporate core grâce à Hugo Boss I\u0026rsquo;m going to guess that this is probably not going to happen, at least not so quickly and not by the duress of another aesthetic. I think it is pretty important to clarify that \u0026ldquo;old money\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;corp-core\u0026rdquo; are aesthetics. They might be more substantial aesthetics than something like \u0026ldquo;blokette\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;strawberry girl\u0026rdquo; (because they have a fairly large fashion vocabulary and history to tap into), but they are still aesthetics. I wonder if aesthetics, due to their nature of burning hot and quickly, can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t have a wider impact on fashion in society. I say this because previous \u0026ldquo;substantial aesthetics\u0026rdquo;, like dark academia or cottagecore, have not really had that much of an impact on society\u0026rsquo;s general fashion in the past. The societal fashions we see everyday still kind of abide by the old trend cycles, it\u0026rsquo;s why we still see more wide jeans today than we see tweed blazers and librarian glasses. If this is the case, then why would corp-core have a more noticeable impact on society?\nI think that fashion trends need to be much slower than their current pace to genuinely impact social trends. The average person is not going to pick up a soccer jersey after hearing of the blokette aesthetic, unless they are very tuned in to online fashion. The average person will, however, buy wide jeans if they keep seeing it season after season, to the point where they become comfortable with it, and even consider it cool. This is why I kind of believe that sneakers are losing popularity, just due to people wearing different styles of shoes (primarily loafers comes to mind) for season after season.\nOf course, these are all just my two cents. I really do wonder how aesthetics will impact fashion and social fashions in the long term, but we\u0026rsquo;ll just have to wait to see.\n"},{"id":85,"href":"/blog/alaia_ss_25/","title":"I Want To Flow Like Water","section":"Blog","content":"\rI Want To Flow Like Water: Alaïa Spring/Summer 2025\r#\rSeptember 8, 2024\nRostov\u0026rsquo;s Coffee and Tea\nNew York Fashion Week is fully underway and while I hope that one day I will, by some grace, get to go see some show in person, for now, I remain stuck dreaming about it. I\u0026rsquo;ve followed fashion weeks on and off for a while now, so my knowledge of runway history is fairly limited. Still, every now and then some show comes by that I find to be so incredible that I have to write about it to be able to return to a state of peace. Right now, that same jitteriness has come to me thanks to Pieter Mulier\u0026rsquo;s Alaïa runway show.\nI should preface this by firstly telling you to watch the runway show here (I will give a slight content warning, as there are sheer clothing in the show). Additionally, I tried to find the show notes, but came up short and so had to rely on what little was available to me. The first thing I found was the video\u0026rsquo;s description, which mentions \u0026ldquo;an obsession with the idea of American beauty\u0026rdquo;. This is rather interesting, as it feels somewhat detached from \u0026ldquo;American beauty\u0026rdquo;, rather choosing to focus on \u0026ldquo;the idea of American beauty\u0026rdquo;.\nI will say, I am barely experienced enough to comment on fashion, so I certainly cannot make any broad claims or comments on American beauty, or the idea of it, but we can somewhat understand some of the themes or general \u0026ldquo;ideas\u0026rdquo; behind American beauty that stand out to Pieter Mulier. According to what I could find online, Pieter Mulier wrote \u0026ldquo;For me, American beauty means freedom, of body and spirit\u0026hellip;This collection is about honoring tradition alongside modernity. It\u0026rsquo;s a celebration of an American ideology of dress and through that a spirit can unite New York and Paris, of the body in motion, liberated.\u0026rdquo;\nThe concepts, then, are pretty clear, and they translate incredibly beautifully into the clothes.\nAlaïa SS25 #6 We can start by looking at the 6th piece in the show. The thing that stands out the most in this piece is the swirly skirt that tapeers downwards. I should note that this show took place in the Guggenheim, which is pretty exceptional in itself, but you can see the idea of the spiral walkway reflected in this piece of clothing pretty directly. This is the first thing that I noticed, the reflection of the clothes in the environment in which they exist.\nAlaïa SS25 #15 You can, again, see very directly that same idea in this piece here, which is again quite swirly. Something else I want to point out about this piece (and all the other pieces), is that it is fairly simple and fairly clean. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean simple in a construction way, because with the way these pieces drape and overlap, I am certain that their construction is incredibly complicated and difficult, but what I rather mean is that there is not an excess of colors, there is not a large amount of ornamentation, and there is not a large amount of contrasting fabrics. There is not much juxtaposition going on here, each piece in the runway show has an idea, and it showcases that idea in a very direct and singular way. Each piece is different, of course, but all together they build upon each other (the nth piece building upon the (n-1)th piece) to, in the end, exhibit Pieter Mulier\u0026rsquo;s concepts in a very elegant way.\nAlaïa SS25 #12 The next theme that I noticed was first made clear to me through this piece, in that it feels very architectural or very sculptural. We can see interesting sectional lines running across this piece of clothing in diagonal ways, which, when combined with the ways the sleeves flow around and into the piece, made the piece feel somewhat sculptural to me.\nAlaïa SS25 #36 This sculptural feeling is significantly more obvious with the 36th piece, which looks kind of like a puffer jacket designed in a way that kind of looks like piping to me. It kind of reminds me of Le Centre Pompidou in Paris with the way that we can directly see \u0026ldquo;pipes\u0026rdquo;.\nMore noteable, though, is the fact that these pieces are also very well attuned to the area they are in. Particularly, seeing sculptural or architectural pieces feels particularly relevant here, as this show is taking place in the Guggenheim.\nI doubt that there was intentionality in making the puffer jacket somewhat appear like Le Centre Pompidou, but it does feel kind of cool to me, as this is a French designer's take on \"American beauty\". In that way, I felt like I could see a merging of French stylisms with an American understanding of art and more general American themes (I'll elaborate on this ladder piece later). Something that I really like about these pieces is that even though a lot of pieces in this show feel sculptural, they all still flow. They flow with the way the models walk and they all seem somewhat soft. Maybe it would be more fair to call it soft sculpturalism or soft architecturalism then?\nAlaïa SS25 #45 This is the last piece that I want to talk about, which also has that same concept of \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; that I mentioned previously, except it flows in the way that it is laid across the model\u0026rsquo;s body, as opposed to flow, in the way that it drapes (though this piece actually does both!). This piece, and the other similar pieces in the show, feel like water to me. Water branches and it twists and it turns as it flows, just like the absent space in this piece.\nNow that we have somewhat discussed the pieces, how does it connect back to Pieter Mulier\u0026rsquo;s notes on the show and the ideas of American beauty?\nI think that the idea of flow that exists in all of these clothes (though in different capacities), is one means of approaching the subject of freedom. We see clothes that drape and flow with movement and in the air, so too do we see clothes whose shapes are very wavy and flowy. The clothes, in this way, feel like water to me, as water is free to flow in whatever space it might exist in. More encapsulated, it can be thought of as both freedom of movement and freedom of shape.\nWe also see some shared themes with the building these clothes are presented in, through the architectural and sculptural themes, as well as the swirls and loops of fabric and clothing. This fits as well as a great homage to a great American building, while also exemplifying the flow, and thus freedom.\nOne other thing to note about this show is the fact of the designer being French. I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure how to explain it (I suppose I haven\u0026rsquo;t acquired a particularly strong fashion lexicon yet), but the way in which the clothes are made (particularly the smoothness and the elegant, but simple, drapery) feel very French to me, which makes this whole show feel very much so as a perception of America through the eyes of a Frenchman, which is exactly what it is by its description!\n"},{"id":86,"href":"/learning_osmnx/","title":"Learning How to Use OSMNX","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rLearning How to Use OSMNX: Mapping the Parisian Metro\r#\rSeptember 28, 2023\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been recently toying around with osmnx quite a bit, mostly because I really wanted to do some urban design and city modeling. I discovered osmnx through this and later, through Geoff Boeing\u0026rsquo;s Blog, became extremely excited at the idea.\nSo I figured I may as well give it a go. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done or worked on many personal projects in a while so this did excite me quite a lot.\nFirstly, I had to choose a city and an idea that I\u0026rsquo;d model out. Something pretty basic to start with in my mind would be modeling a city itself, and then perhaps do some kind of shortest path earch on the metro overlayed upon the city.\nBecause I have an immense bias to everything French, I immediately chose to do Paris.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to first pull up a city and model it through a network with osmnx:\nG = ox.graph_from_place(\u0026#34;Paris, France\u0026#34;) ox.plot_graph(G) Our first model of Paris\rThe data we recieve here is all modeled with networkx, so it is, in effect, a modeling of nodes and edges. In this case, I believe we are modeling the streets/roads of Paris and the connections between them. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of how this looks, so let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and change it up a bit.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by taking a look at our data itself, and how it\u0026rsquo;s structured:\ngdf_nodes, gdf_edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G) gdf_nodes.head() Description of our data\rWe can take this data and just restructure it and redesign its output and thus its appearance:\nG2 = ox.graph_from_gdfs(gdf_nodes, gdf_edges, graph_attrs=G.graph) ox.plot_graph(G2, node_size=0, bgcolor=\u0026#34;#ffffff\u0026#34;, node_color=\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;) Redesigned model of Paris\rAlright, now that we have a somewhat decent model of Paris up, we can now consider their metro system. We can do this by performing a filter on the data that we get from osmnx where we look in particular for railways and subways ([\u0026quot;railway\u0026quot;~\u0026quot;subway\u0026quot;]).\nG3 = ox.graph_from_place(\u0026#34;Paris, France\u0026#34;, retain_all=False, truncate_by_edge=True, simplify=True, custom_filter=\u0026#39;[\u0026#34;railway\u0026#34;~\u0026#34;subway\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;) ox.plot_graph(G3) Model of Paris's Metro\rAlright! So that looks about right. The design isn\u0026rsquo;t fantastic, but we can fix that, or we can make it look even more ridiculous!

In that case, we can at least go off of the osmid, which looks like a unique identifier for these different transportation nodes, but I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure. Let\u0026rsquo;s take, for instance 29588070 as our beginning station on the metro and 325664764 as our destination station.

Pretty neat! Unfortunately, it would be a bit difficult to build a system out of this that would let me choose two different stations by name and then see the shortest path that way, but perhaps another city would have those options. For now, this was at least a good enough introduction for me into osmnx. I really like all the features available with this, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be trying to do a lot more with it in the future.\n"},{"id":87,"href":"/literature/","title":"Literature","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rPoetry\r#\rHere lies my poetry, which is likely to be divided up into published and un-published work.\nThis is also of middling quality.\nFloyd County Moonshine\nThe Kudzu Vine\nAcademy of the Heart and Mind\nPier by Northerly Island\nEvergreen Out The Window\nVariations of Wind\nSequoias\nMadeleines\nThe Taste of Honeycrisp\nSage Cigarettes\nSorry About the Ghosts\nShort Stories\r#\rStories that I have written of a reasonably short nature.

Most people I talk with tend to find that the pricing for some pieces of clothing that they find to be rather simple (a sweater or a white shirt, for instance) to be excessively high at certain stores and labels. Often I hear things like \u0026ldquo;a white shirt shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cost $100, mine cost $30!\u0026rdquo; While I can understand the feeling that paying $100 for a shirt seems high when all you are used to buying (or all that is marketed towards you or any of us these days) is $30 shirts, your $30 shirt is wildly unsustainable.\nA white shirt here refers to a standard white dress shirt one commonly sees worn with a suit or skirt (like this one here).\nQuality\r#\rThe quality of a cheaper shirt is noticeable in comparison to a more expensive shirt. There are of course stragglers (Daniel Wellington types), but I can better explain with an example. I have owned two different types of white dress shirts before, one from Express (generally around $60) and one from Charles Tyrwhitt (generally around $120).\nThe first time I put on the Charles Tyrwhitt shirt, I was genuinely surprised by how good it felt and how much nicer it was. Firstly, standard dress shirts are meant to be tucked into trousers. However, the majority of dress shirts sold at fast fashion establishments are very short, far too short to be comfortably tucked into trousers. My Express shirts tend to get untucked at some angle if I stretch my arms out fully above my head (but are clearly made to be tucked in, the hem isn\u0026rsquo;t straight around the waist but rather has tails). The Charles Tyrwhitt shirt is noticeably longer, and clearly made to be tucked in.\nAlso noticeable are the cuffs and sleeves. The Express cuffs are incredibly small and the sleeves themselves fit about exact, but are extremely slim and close to your arms. This is quite unbreathable and gets rather uncomfortable fast. Charles Tyrwhitt sleeves are long and wide enough to be breathable. The cuffs are also of an ample length, and comfortably lie under a suit jacket with plenty of show. The collar of the Express shirt is also on the smaller side, and flies around a lot, whereas the Tyrwhitt collar is large and stays in place.\nRegardless, there are many, many comparisons I can make on quality here, but they all lead to the same place. You are (generally) seeing a greater level of quality at higher prices. I say generally, because there are companies that market themselves as being \u0026ldquo;of high quality\u0026rdquo;, but sell clothing comparable to fast fashion. You can imagine Daniel Wellington but for clothing more generally if that is in your purview. Additionally, there are brands of good quality who sell at cheaper prices. Yes Friends is a fantastic example of this; Uniqlo used to be a good example, but I can\u0026rsquo;t really vouch for it anymore.\nUniqlo is rather interesting here actually, because it started as a company with fantastic fabrics that brought quality and technical clothing to a wider audience thanks to its cheaper price (while still having fairly decent quality). Their denim was exceptional as well. However, various revelations about Uniqlo and its business practices have come to light that put the company in a rather different picture. This letter to Uniqlo is a fascinating read. I would also like to be able to read \u0026ldquo;The Glory and Disgrace of Uniqlo\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;ユニクロ帝国の光と影 \u0026ldquo;), by Masuo Yokata, but sadly no translation for it exists as of yet.\nEven beyond that, Express really isn\u0026rsquo;t the worst example I could use in comparison, and Charles Tyrwhitt isn\u0026rsquo;t the best example I could give. They\u0026rsquo;re just the ones that I am the most used to. If I can defer to the experts for a moment, the Charles Tyrwhitt shirt that was $120 could still be considered middle tier (or even entry tier depending on your own purview). Bonneguelle uses the following generalized ideas as a guide for the quality of clothing\nEntry Level listed at 40€ - 100€, with brands like Suitsupply and Uniqlo\nUniqlo Fall Winter 2023, Look 1 Suitsupply Spring Collection, 2024 Middle Tier listed at 100€ - 160€, with brands like Hast and Percival Menswear\nHoward's Spring Summer 2020 Percival, Late Summer Knitwear High Tier listed at 160€ - 200€+, with brands like Husbands and Berg \u0026amp; Berg\nHusbands Fall Winter 2023 Berg \u0026 Berg, Tailoring I really love Husbands Paris, like immensely so, and have never gotten the chance to talk about it. But the textures, silhouettes, styling, everything is just immactulate and fantastic and beautiful. The founder, Nicolas Gabbard, additionally, has immaculate style and is always dressed incredibly. I still know people who would say things like \u0026ldquo;My $30 shirt has lasted me 4 years!!!\u0026rdquo;, but I still find the argument fairly negligible. The average garment is work seven to ten times before it is thrown out, and regardless, most of these arguments come from confirmation bias. Someone sees an item they own lasting them a while and so feels the need to ignore the more typical fast fashion experience.\nDesign\r#\rThe average piece of clothing from a fast fashion organization is designed by some poor designer who is worked to the absolute bone sketching out designs at a breakneck pace. The very pace by which these people have to exist in their working lives does not allow for time to genuinely reflect on a design and incorporate detailing to a significant structure.\nYou might claim that Asos, H\u0026amp;M, and Shein all have designs comprable to high end or middle tier fashion brands (by stealing the original designs). And while you might be right at first glance, the second you start to compare the texture, material, and smaller detailing on these pieces of clothing, the chasm is quite vast. A classic example would be a fast fashion blazer. The sleeves of a blazer have (generally) four buttons on the cuff. These buttons are completely unfunctional on most fast fashion blazers. This is not always true, but tends to be the case. A higher quality garment would actually have functional design elements that exist for a reason. Those buttons being actually buttonable isn\u0026rsquo;t even that difficult of a thing to do, it would just be an additional cost to an item that is made to be looked at and not lived in.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s really what my feelings about fast fashion garments boil down to. They are items that are made to look nice at a quick glance, but are not items that you could live in, they are not items that will get their own sheen or feel or story, but an item that will be thrown out after a year of wear. I feel like the act of getting through the use of clothing so quickly, and wearing clothes that have less meaning on a body than on a metal wire rack, just loses a lot of the love and charm that goes into fashion and the act of wearing clothes. It can be so much more meaningful if the clothes that we wear have something to them beyond a pretty face.\nNYC street style from instagram; clothes that appear to have developed their own style through wear\rLabor\r#\rThe average cheaper piece of clothing is almost certainly abusing labor at at least one point in its production timeline. A discussion of labor when it comes to fashion is incredibly overdone by this point, but it\u0026rsquo;s still notable. There is still an immense amount of child labor involved in the production of clothing, and, in general, there is a very large amount of abuse that occurs in factories that produce clothing and abuse that occurs at the fashion companies themselves. This all completely ignore the terrible salaries and even wage theft that occurs at these factories and by these companies. How else would the average t-shirt you buy at a fast fashion store manage to cost so cheap?\nEnvironment\r#\rThere are various different ways to measure the impact of various different clothing items, because different clothing items are made in different ways. The average T-shirt, for instance, would travel about 32,000 kilometers before it gets to the store it is sold at. How much do you think you should pay for a t-shirt that justifies that amount of travel? Ignoring t-shirts, consider jeans instead, where it takes 1,800 gallons of water to produce just the cotton needed for a single pair.\nI can spend forever just spouting out various costs of fashion to the environment, but there are many many people out there who are good authorities on the subject that I would extend you to.\nI quite enjoyed Climate Town\u0026rsquo;s videos on fast fashion and merch for this particular subject.\nI can understand the basic reasoning behind someone complaining about costly shirting and finding such things absurd. It\u0026rsquo;s really the fault of companies for shoving cheap things down our throats over many many many years, with the addition of a genuinely concerning amount of marketing and commercials. Yet, fast fashion is not worth it, it\u0026rsquo;s damage is immense, and it really is not worth the value. Buying quality pieces of clothing from quality manufacturers and producers not only allows you to get a nicer piece of clothing but also allows for the humanity inherent in the system of clothes-making. Quality is worth it.\n"},{"id":94,"href":"/blog/language_qualms/","title":"Qualms with Fashion as Language","section":"Blog","content":"\rQualms with Fashion as Language\r#\rAugust 20, 2025\nNowhere in particular\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in the idea of fashion as language for a while now. Of course, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a new idea by any means, I\u0026rsquo;d first heard about it through Derek Guy of \u0026ldquo;Die, Workwear\u0026rdquo; a few years back. This is a very appealing idea, and explains a lot about modern fashion to me. Something that I\u0026rsquo;ve found interesting about fashion since around 2020 is that aesthetics seem to have started to play the forefront in the ideas being expressing by people exploring fashion (most prominently online). I first noticed this with aesthetics like \u0026ldquo;dark academia\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cottage-core\u0026rdquo;, where people were dressing to express an affiliation with an idea first and foremost.\nIn this way, fashion as language makes a lot of sense, right? The people participating in these aesthetics are wearing these clothes and mixing these ideas to express an idea or to affiliate themselves with an idea. The people dressing in dark academia wanted to affiliate themselves with the idea of bookishness, literature, university, and academia (with gothic undertones). The same goes with the languages of \u0026ldquo;cottagecore\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;normcore\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;zizmorcore\u0026rdquo; and so on so forth.\nThis woman is \"speaking the language\" of normcore with her outfit. Taken from Vogue. Of course, when Derek Guy was speaking of the idea of fashion as a language, he was more specifically referring to fully fleshed out styles. Think of ivy, prep, americana, workwear, and punk, for example. Each of these are styles of which we have a clear image in our head. So, if I am correctly understanding the way that Derek Guy explains these languages, these styles are ideas that we can speak to through the way we dress. In this way, these styles will always look great because they already have a fashion (and cultural) lexicon by which they have been developed!\nThis is a really great metaphor for fashion, especially for how fashion feels to me in this modern day. We are all tapping into aesthetics, styles, and ideas to some degree when we dress ourselves. It does feel like a language, like we are harkening back to something or some people with every piece of garment we put on. And that\u0026rsquo;s a lovely idea! I really mean it, this metaphor has truly impacted the way I view outfits and how I dress myself in the morning.\nJulian Casablancas is tapping into a history of punk and of rock with this graphic t-shirt and ripped skinny jeans. Taken from Husbands Paris. The interesting thing about these languages and with the way I see people dressing, though, is that the interaction with the ideas they represent is purely through fashion. If we take something like punk, it was the music that came first, and then the clothes that came to identify you as part of that tribe. On the other hand, if we look at dark academia, it was the fashion and aesthetic that came before the pursuit of literature and the humanities. This isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily true for everybody involved in this aesthetic, but there is a reason we consider some of these styles \u0026ldquo;aesthetics\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;subcultures\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tribes\u0026rdquo;. In this way, it can occasionally feel like while we may be speaking the language of a style, we are not actually partaking in the culture that style was birthed from. While this distinction does exist between aesthetics and subcultures, it does seem that even when we follow subcultural styles, we are doing it purely aesthetically.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t actually find this point to be a problem, personally, mostly because cultures can change. While suits and ivy might be fundamentally tied up with some set of ideologies (wealth, elite universities, etc.) in America, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that same thing in, for instance, Japan, and things that start purely as aesthetics can evolve to become more than that. This sort of arm-wringing about people \u0026ldquo;posing\u0026rdquo; as something they aren\u0026rsquo;t has been around for a very long time, and isn\u0026rsquo;t really an issue for me.\nRecently, I read an article by Charlie Caulfield titled \u0026ldquo;Ditch the Fashion Guide\u0026rdquo;, which expressed ideas that I heavily agree with. I strongly recommend you read the article, but the core of it is that we are giving away too much of our thought to manuals for how to dress and that fashion now really feels filled with references to references to references. In this way, I do feel like we are several times divorced from the ground truth of the original fashion ideas that we are expressing.\nTo explain that further, an example that I have been thinking a lot about is ivy fashion (mostly because I recently finished reading Ametora). Specifically, when I\u0026rsquo;m going to work, I\u0026rsquo;m often wearing an oxford collar button down (OCBD) and some form of chinos. One of these past days, I noticed I was selectively wearing clothes from Japan: I was wearing a white OCBD from Kamakura and grey chinos from Uniqlo. Both of these companies have connections to VAN Jacket, the company that brought ivy fashion to Japan. Notably, the man who created Kamakura used to work for VAN jacket, and the father of the man who created Uniqlo sold VAN jacket garments! Kamakura is, thus, heavily influenced by that Japanese take on ivy style, and Uniqlo is to some degree birthed of that world as well.\nYoshio Sadasue (the founder of Kamakura shirts) with Kensuke Ishizu (the founder of VAN jacket and the man that brough ivy to Japan). Taken from Kamakura Shirts. This is both cool and weird right? I am an American wearing clothes from Japan that were originally made to mimic the styles of American students in ivy league universities in the 1950s and 1960s. Added to that, I\u0026rsquo;m a second generation Indian immigrant, which further confuses any of the ideas I\u0026rsquo;m expressing here! Which language am I speaking when I am wearing these clothes? Am I speaking the language of those old American students, or a language of the Japanese who re-created these garments? Or am I speaking a totally new language here? Does my identity change the ideas I\u0026rsquo;m expressing? If I\u0026rsquo;m following these ideas of fashion as language, though, how can I be speaking a totally new language if I am wearing these garments that are categorically apart of \u0026ldquo;ivy\u0026rdquo; (even if that might mean a lot of different things now)?\nI think that is where context comes in. The Japanese that were wearing ivy were referencing American ivy through that \u0026ldquo;language\u0026rdquo;, but made it their own to some degree. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m wearing ivy and referencing both Japan and America through the \u0026ldquo;language\u0026rdquo; that I\u0026rsquo;m speaking. But isn\u0026rsquo;t that inherently referential? I\u0026rsquo;m not adding in any new ideas by wearing these garments external to myself the person wearing them. This idea of fashion as language has to be referential because you are speaking a language that has already been developed. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, this is still a fundamentally good way to dress due to that pre-defined language and culture, but it means that we might be missing out on making new ideas.\nThis is something that has bothered me a bit recently. I think that when we look back at certain fashion styles of certain decades and periods and subcultures, we can strongly associate some fashions with these time periods and ideas. We associate the 70s with hippies and we associate leather, plaid, and safety pins with punk. We literally have a current aesthetic for Y2K! There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with engaging with these ideas, they\u0026rsquo;re all really cool ideas and I engage with them too, I just wish we had a way of moving forward with these ideas towards something new and that feels of this moment.\nThis is a look from Diesel in Spring 2022, which is referencing Y2K. Taken from Vogue. This is where my problem with the idea of expressing ourselves through a \u0026ldquo;language of fashion\u0026rdquo; comes from, mostly through how languages are inherently referential (as a language must already exist for you to be able to speak it). I want new ideas to be created! I want our modern world and themes of our modern world to be captured by the clothes we wear! I feel like by limiting ourselves to pre-existing languages we confine ourselves to the past, which while it can certainly be a useful lens to analyze our current world through, doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily push the letter in terms of what has changed, or what we have learned.\nBut that makes me question how we can even push the letter now. My experience of fashion, and maybe yours too, is very much so something of nostalgia and continuous references to things of our youth and before. After reading the article earlier by Charlie Caulfield, I ended up asking them on Instagram about this and about how they thought we can dress for the \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo;:\nIn terms of pushing the letter and creating something modern\u0026hellip;I thought about which big designers are fulfilling that right now, and I first thought of Jonathan Anderson and Duran Lantink. Both of their sensibilities are very MODERN to me, but they both also reference the past constantly. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a few factors\u0026hellip; Pulling from sources outside of just fashion when thinking about history can lead to something surprisingly fresh (I know Anderson pulls a lot from art), combining several disparate time periods, going directly against the grain of what\u0026rsquo;s en Vogue, and taking one element that\u0026rsquo;s already been done and exaggerating it (in size, proportion, color, silhouette, etc.). I think that if you\u0026rsquo;re a really great designer, stylist, or fashion enthusiast, you can absorb myriad references and visuals, and the context you live in will shape your creation into something that could only exist now, in this moment\u0026hellip;I also think it\u0026rsquo;s a trap to say subversion is always the answer to staying ahead of the trends, because you end up being equally dictated by whatever is popular at the time.\nThis is a look from JW Anderson in Spring/Summer 2025. When asked about the text, Anderson responded \"It's more like this idea of starting from a blank page...Where is the next decade going, and how do we work with it?\" Taken from WWD. And I am inclined to agree with them! I don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure how certain ideas came about in the past, or even if the sorts of strike in a pan moments can necessarily be recreated in a way to foster a subcultural community like it would have 50 years ago, but I know that these ideas come from somewhere real. I will certainly be trying to look to the world around me or what I see to pull from, and I\u0026rsquo;m curious to see where that will take me. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly what a lot of designers are doing and where they might get their ideas from. There is a lot of inspiration to pull from this world if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to look.\nThe language of fashion is an idea that I like a lot and that I agree with. I just think it can be limiting in some capacities that I really care about and want to see grown throughout the future. Hopefully, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to start pulling from the present for the way I dress, instead of just the past.\n"},{"id":95,"href":"/research/","title":"Research","section":"Arsh Siddiqui","content":"\rResearch\r#\rThis is all of the research publications I have been involved in and worked on over the past number of years.

Quite often the things for which demand is being generated for are not necessities. This is to be expected of course, the vast majority of things the average person is likely to purchase is not something they need for survival, yet generated demand still feels rather questionable in nature doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? And when you couple it with connections that are being made between marketing and neuroscience, in effect studying the brain to determine how we act and manipulating that to purchase things, it feels even worse. Tackling an issue like free will or self determination here is wildly out of my knowledge level and understanding, but it does have an intersection with personal style and how we dress ourselves that I do find rather interesting.\nAny and all of us who are interested in fashion would like to believe that we have complete control over how we dress ourselves and how we present ourselves to the world around us. And in some sense, fashion allows us a very direct way of self-presentation. It is, after all, the first thing any person will develop in relation to you. Speaking for myself, I definitely (attempt to) tailor how I appear depending on who I am meeting (or expect to meet) and where I am. Surely then, I would like to have full control over how I appear and all decisions related to that.\nAnd like every sane fashion enthusiast, I continue to disregard the weather when making stylisic decisions. I will absolutely wear sweaters in 80 degree weather.\nOur clothes, then, should be an extension of ourselves. It should enhance our perceptions of ourselves, or how we desire to perceive ourselves, and should accurately signify that image to others. There are always going to be communication issues, of course, in that certain signifiers that may clearly indicate one thing to us could indicate something else to someone else (imagine improperly encoded unicode characters leading to incorrectly translated messages between two phones or how black can mean mourning in one culture and something totally different in another culture). This issue of communication, however, isn\u0026rsquo;t something we need be bogged down in, because another more interesting question arises therein, namely are we truly identifying ourselves through our clothing?\nDo you see someone dressed up for work or something casual?\rFor one, the vast majority of us do not make our own clothes, we seek out clothes that we like and that possibly relate to us in some way or another. These clothes each have a message correlated with them, either literally (with printed textual shirts - which can just directly display a message), or through social ques (like a winchester shirt, which one can connote to banking). It is interesting, then, to consider that we are seeking to develop (or enhance) meaning for ourselves through things that were not created by us, but for us. And those designers can very well have very different imaginings and/or significances they themselves imbue into the pieces they create. The finance guy that wishes to be perceived as a finance guy will purchase the blue oxford collar button down, brown chinos, and grey patagonia vest, because they wish to be seen as part of \u0026ldquo;the tribe\u0026rdquo;, yet that vest they wear was designed and sold by a company that very much so supports environmentalism and slow consumption (at least at face value, this ladder concern is a wholly new issue unto itself), the opposite of a money driven and imbued career.\nWinchester shirt correlates with baking. This is also an example how I wanted to dress when I was in high school\rSo in one way it is strange that we take clothes designed by others and purport our own meaning unto them, where our meaning can overshadow the original intention. However, that example of the finance guy (and even the examples before) are of a very mainstream perception. If I was to, for instance, discuss consumers of Yohji Yamamoto or Rick Owens, we would be reaching into a very different, but interesting territory.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll preface this by saying that I personally can not consider myself an expert or even somewhat knowledgeable on fashion, and especially fashion of the variance that I will proceed to talk about. In this way, a lot of what I perceive and discuss will likely be from a very abstracted angle.\nFrom what I have been able to observe of fans of designers like these (Yamamoto and Owens), I can see that they use clothing to paint a picture of themselves to a much stronger degree than the vast majority of us do. For instance, right now I\u0026rsquo;m wearing a grey puppytooth polo tucked into some salt and pepper trousers. This does portray an image (even moreso because I\u0026rsquo;m writing this while sitting at a cafe), but it isn\u0026rsquo;t as strong as say how the \u0026ldquo;Rick enthusiast\u0026rdquo; works with their clothes. Their outfits are very self descriptive, and you can see a lot of a person in them.\nYohji Yamamoto Fall/Winter 2022. This is also an example of how I wanted to dress in sophomore year of university.\rI\u0026rsquo;m going to move away from those two designers, because I do not know enough to speak about them. However, what I have mentioned about them is applicable to many different designers, and designers of many different generations and times. Consider Yves Saint Laurent: what sort of image do you have of a woman that wears YSL? I\u0026rsquo;ll speak of the mid to late 1960s, when he debuted \u0026ldquo;le smoking\u0026rdquo; jacket, so that I can capture a particular image. To me, the kind of woman who would wear Saint Laurent of that time was somebody who was elegant, sophisticated, cool, and ambiguous: the kind of person who would chainsmoke outside a parisian opera, and look mysterious and seductive while doing so. These kinds of designers have such a strong image of perception attached to their clothing that even the whisper of their name can paint an imaginative wonderland into the minds of those even vaguely aware.\n\"Le smoking\" jacket. Also an example of how I want to dress now.\rThe image I described in the above paragraph is effectively this image, but that was kind of the purpose of this exercise. The image itself has such a social cachet that my imagination of the \"YSL woman\" defaults to this woman whom I don't know.\nYet, how can one\u0026rsquo;s personal style be defined in such a way? What I have just described doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily sound personal does it? Some among us might say that what designers and brands are really doing is selling an image to consumers who are gullible enough to want to pursue that image (generated demand - feeling as though you need to be perceived in such a way, and can only do that by purchasing and wearing clothes made by X designer). Indeed, in some respects a good designer is able to create and attach characteristics to their clothing; they are able to create an imaginary person who would be the \u0026ldquo;wearer\u0026rdquo; of their clothes, an imaginary person who you could become and inhabit with the right amount of money.\nThink back to the woman who would wear the YSL smoking jacket. What does she do in her free time? What kind of person is she? What kinds of conversations would she have? What would she read/watch/listen to? Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be like this fictitious woman, but there are many who do, and Saint Laurent was able to create an image of a woman that many did (and still do) aspire to.\nBut to the consumers of these designers: they genuinely feel like they can see themselves in those clothes. What right do I have to tell them that they\u0026rsquo;re just endlessly pursuing an effigy crafted and commodified by a designer? If it is meaningful to them, why not let them vivre leur vie? And yet, generated demand still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It still feels that the idea of designers making a pipeline towards an idea that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, a road paved with lots of clothing bills, is not necessarily an honest way of designing clothes. But still, that is their job! Good designers are able to create those imaginary worlds and figures, and the pieces that were best able to achieve that became pieces of history - clothing you can see at the Met! But to paint myself with ideas and emotions crafted by others feels dishonest in some weird way.\nI think it feels dishonest to me because, with clothes like those, I can easily manipulate my self perception to others, depending on what I want. Almost as though I always have a mask affixed that can present me in any way I want. There still persists that common addage that clothes are a person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;armor to get them through the day\u0026rdquo; anyhow. In this view, it becomes an extension of my inability to tell anybody else who I am really, or to let them see that.\nMaybe this is just a me problem...\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really know, though. These are just my two cents on the idea of individuality or personal perception through fashion. Really, as with most things, it is probably just related to how we as beings act socially, and with what we personally seek out in social relationships. Those mesh with how we dress ourselves, and thus any and all of our desires therein can be harnessed by designers and brands to make lots of money.\n"},{"id":97,"href":"/blog/balmacaan/","title":"The Balmacaan","section":"Blog","content":"\rBig Fan of the Balmacaan\r#\rJuly 7, 2025\nNowhere in particular\nAuralee Autumn/Winter 2025 - Look 36. Pulled from Vogue Runway. It is exceedingly hot throughout much of the Eastern seabord of the United States at the moment, and I\u0026rsquo;m finding some respite by looking at clothes from the chillier months. This has led me to one of my favorite garments, the balmacaan!\nThis is a garment that I was surprised to find that I love so much, mostly because when I first started liking winter overcoats, I really wanted to have a lapel on it in some form, over just a collar. However, after purchasing my own balmacaan and wearing it extensively, I\u0026rsquo;ve found much to love from its simplicity.\nFirstly, what exacty is a balmacaan? Well, I\u0026rsquo;m sure definitions change from person to person, but to me, a balmacaan coat is a winter overcoat with raglan sleeves, typically single breasted, and typically long and voluminous. The coat allegeldy originates from an estate near Inverness in Scotland. Traditionally, it was rather long and wide. Yes, that is a very springy definition, my apologies. This definition also begs the question of what a raglan sleeve is, which is, more simply, a sleeve that is a single piece extended up to the collar. In the above picture from Auralee, you can see that the sleeve on that grey coat is a singular piece, not broken by any shoulders. This gives the coat a much softer, de-constructed, casual look, that I think makes it excellent for a modern wardrobe.\nI purchased a balmacaan coat about one and a half years ago, mostly because the particular coat was considerably on sale and had a decent enough fabric makeup for me to not feel like I was just buying well designed plastic. Immidiately upon wearing it, I felt it was both way too long and way to wide. I had, up till that point, been more used to the millennial silhouette of winter coats. However, it was surprisingly well made for what I paid for it, and it was very warming, which was useful for winters at both my university and home city.\nMy balmacaan coat! It's a dark green, wide overcoat that goes down to below my ankles. It is huge, voluminous, and I feel immenseley at ease within it. There are some garments that I have or have seen on other people that \u0026ldquo;feel like home\u0026rdquo;. They are clothes that, once you put them on, you feel at ease and especially comfortable, and maybe comforted. This balmacaan is that kind of a garment to me. I think this has to do in part to its size, and it is huge! It feels a lot like a blanket whenever I put it on, and like I\u0026rsquo;m being totally swathed in wool.\nRegardless of my personal love for this coat, it does have a lot of utility for the winter. I find they typically have huge pockets, big enough to fit a pair of gloves and a knit beanie in each (something I\u0026rsquo;m frequently doing when I\u0026rsquo;m going indoors and back out again), making them pretty useful beyond warmth. They have been sported by many, many stylist people who I look up to, and they look really cool! These coats, also, have the fantastic quality of being cape-like. When unbuttoned and walking around, due to their weight and size, they flow around you incredibly dramatically, which is a feature in clothing design that I can really appreciate.\nWearing a balmacaan with wide and baggy jeans along with and a think striped turtleneck. Taken from Cluel magazine. One last thing I\u0026rsquo;d like to say about these coats is that, due to their unconstructed style, they are well suited to a not excessively formal wardrobe. I\u0026rsquo;m not typically wearing very sharp suits on a daily basis, and I feel like this type of coat can go over almost anything I wear, from chunky knit sweaters, to button downs and thinner sweaters layered in interesting ways. I could also see more casual suits or even fun ties going pretty well under a coat like this. In this way, they feel like a overcoat that works pretty well for a modern wardrobe.\nMiscellaneous photos I liked\r#\rTaken from eyecmag. Taken from ownfeaturecolor.

This discusses, in brief, some information about the Pacific theatre of the war, and some details that are quite critical to the development of modern society since then, that should be known by much more Americans.\nThe End of the English Major\nA lot was discussed in this article - a lot that I want to explore, think about, and write about. Generally it deals with humanitites majors today and the shifts they are facing. These shifts are related to both society\u0026rsquo;s view of them, their ability to adapt to changing interests (and desires), and some thought about its future. In particular with this last point, there was some thought going to the idea that the humanities could be the future, which is something I really want to write about.\nGiving Bambi the Boot\nMore information about deer, their societal view, and the danger they pose to certain environments that I could have ever asked for. Also, one of the few articles I have been able to view on a website with almost no bloat.\nHow to Keep a Great Magazine Going\nThis discusses the history of a magazine I had not known much about that has recently celebrated its 50th year. Given all the struggles journalism, news reporting, and magazines have gone through in this digital age, reading about a magazine trying to eke out a world within it, and seeing it survive, is lovely.\nRereading Russian Classics in the Shadow of the Ukraine War\nJust a lot of interesting and thought provoking discussion about Russia\u0026rsquo;s historical relationship with Ukraine through the lens of Russian literature. I think this article gives a lot of explanation towards Ukranians views towards certain authors (Alexander Pushkin in particular). It also sets up the reading of certain authors in a light I would not have considered (like Nikolai Gogol\u0026rsquo;s The Nose).\nWhat We Search For\nBoth an article about the long and ongoing search for a missing person in California\u0026rsquo;s Eastern Sierra and a story about coming to terms with loss.

Cult-like followings of certain brands or aesthetics have become more popular than ever, and now brands have seen, or will see, a need to attract these consumers to survive. Attracting this consumer base is no doubt of great importance for the survival of brands, particularly those that are smaller or are still growing.\nRather than traditional larger subsets of fashion subcultures, there are presently a large amount of small subgroups of people eking out a sizeable portion of the general genre of style. Consider the large amount of fashion magazines with their small, but loyal audiences. Magazines like Purple, Self-Service, or even The Gentlewoman are all fairly unique, small magazines that all have small audiences (in fact, there is even a novel published by Ane Lynge-Jorlen that recognizes the achievements of these niche fashion magazines: \u0026ldquo;Niche Fashion Magazines: Changing the Shape of Fashion\u0026rdquo;).\nPrevious copies of The Gentlewoman\rOne doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have to look towards the prevalence of niche magazines to see the growth of subcultures, reddit and other social media services, for instance, can be used to find more and more cultures for the most specific of styles and manners. In this sense, it can feel like while the popularity of any one style or aesthetic may not be particularly large, the quantity of aesthetics with a decent following has increased (one can go through the bowels of the aesthetics wikia to get an idea). This quantity has lead to extremely non-mainstream styles like menocore (Nancy Meyers/Eileen Fisher/etc.) and zizmorcore (New York kitsch) to develop followings on places like TikTok.\nExample of zizmorcore\rIt seems reasonable, then, for brands to target these small subcultures as a way to maintain relevance. In fact, some brands may even feel that they could survive with a small, but loyal fanbase. There are assuredly many brands that have done so successfully, however I believe this to be a rather risky move.\nFor one, fanbases are fickle. This is especially the case in the world of fashion. They don\u0026rsquo;t last forever and their followers cannot be trusted for sustained activity. Anybody that\u0026rsquo;s spent more than a month on TikTok or has heard of microtrends would know this to be the case. Nobody dresses up as pirates or wenches or sings shanties as much as they did that one week in June 2020 (external to the age of seafaring of course).\nOf course, only companies with large range, like Shein, were able to target these trends, but how can you tell beforehand if a trend will be sustained or it will die within a week? My guess is that if you were a smaller company and thought seafaring pirates would be the theme of the decade and put a lot of development into it, you would have collapsed quickly.\nAdditionally, brands that start small, by targeting a specific aesthetic or style, will always have the option to go large and target more styles, perhaps more general styles. This is what happened to the Banana Republic, which started with what most might consider to be a safari (or safari inspired) style. While today they may be paying homage to their birthright, they\u0026rsquo;ve stuck with a pretty simple \u0026ldquo;business-friendly\u0026rdquo; style for quite a long time.\nBanana Republic\u0026rsquo;s heritage of \u0026ldquo;the safari\u0026rdquo; is prety colonialist isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nI mean this image is just inches away from a group of white people strutting around some colonial clubhouse in an African or Asian town in white linen suits, though I suppse that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too surprising given the naming convention.\nThese companies will also have to continuously ask themselves if they could become more profitable by switching their lanes. Consider, if you will, a boardwalk on a beach. If there is one person selling soda on the boardwalk, they should position themselves towards the center, so that they are at a vantage point towards all consumers.\nWhat if two people were selling soda on the boardwalk?\nThey would cannibalize each others\u0026rsquo; sales by staying near each other, so they would each be at two ends of the boardwalk.\nIf a third person comes along, they would likely situate themselves an equal distance from each company so as to be approachable from the most people.\nThis is all only true if each company were angels and did not want to cannibalize others\u0026rsquo; sales.\nConsider that if there were two sellers on the boardwalk, one of the sellers could keep moving towards the other side and poach more and more of the other sellers\u0026rsquo; consumers without losing their own. As the quantity of sellers increases, this will become more of an issue.\nThis metaphor is applicable to many different scenarios and circumstances (why do all radio stations play the same music?), but I feel that it has a particular relation to that of the stylistic choices that any one brand can choose to make, at least in the theoretical platonic ideal world. The real world is messy, of course, with issues like brand legacy and company size playing a key role in the relevance of the above metaphor. Yet, considering the world that smaller brands or newer brands are birthed into, and given that in order for them to be able to market themselves towards an audience successfully, they have to make styling decisions that would make them worth your attention, I think it is a fair comparision.\nThis is why more general fashion brands succeed, and why it is easy for small fashion labels aiming at a niche style to fail (at least theoretically). They can easily grow a larger audience by also targeting some other style. Or, a larger label could poach their sales by also selling something in the target style. This ladder issue could easily kill a small company, even if it wanted to remain true to its aesthetic.\nThese concerns will hang like daggers over the proverbial head of the company at all times. Becoming successful in ones\u0026rsquo; aesthetic lane takes a lot more than just correctly targeting a fanbase, but would require a lot of luck that nobody will encroach on your (limited) consumer base, and would require you to ignore profits to produce a single style. The deck is stacked against you.\n"},{"id":101,"href":"/blog/2025/09/23/","title":"The Value in Feeling Clothes","section":"Blog","content":"\rThe Value in Feeling Clothes\r#\rSeptember 23, 2025\nNowhere in particular\nQuite often when I am talking to people about fashion and clothes, they bring up the very high price point of luxury clothes as a common criticism. Often, they perceive the price of these garments to be far too high in relation to the product that you are getting. I have changed my opinion a lot about pricing when it comes to clothes. At first, I tended to believe that higher prices generally resulted in higher quality clothes that would last longer. That is not necessarily true any more (maybe it was never true) and, regardless, the relation to which the price increase of a garment relates to the quality increase in the real world might not seem to be the most reasonable to the general viewer.\nFor me, a lot of the clothes I am interested in buying have had some form of a trade-off in clothing design, quality, and price. For the most basic of clothes, things like oxford cloth button downs, wool sweaters, and raw denim, the prices can vary a lot, but at some point, the noticeable differences become more minor. For more avant-garde clothes, the barrier to entry is going to be a bit higher, because certain designs will be inherently harder to produce than others.\nA more avant-garde look from ROSEN. This outfit involves a button down shirt with a tied sash above the waist, cropped pants, and a linen poncho-like jacket that drapes slightly windswept behind the wearer. This was probably difficult to produce. Pulled from The Rosenrot. Going back to the more \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; clothes, you can buy a lot of these garments incredibly cheaply at an H\u0026amp;M or Zara or something similar, but they will be noticeably worse than clothes even slightly higher on the quality scale. If I take the example of an oxford cloth button down (OCBD), the first one I had ever bought was probably from Express. It would\u0026rsquo;ve felt like plastic and looked super glossy and shiny in a weird way. A number of years ago, I had gotten a new one from Uniqlo, when they had first expanded into my area. The quality jump was noticeable, both in the way the garment felt, and also in the way it appeared. The fabric was 100% cotton, it had a softy grey color that didn\u0026rsquo;t glare in light, and it fit my body pretty well. There were still some noticeable setbacks, like how the collar was still pretty small (so it didn\u0026rsquo;t have a good collar roll), the buttons were sewn very tightly onto the shirt (so the fabric warped in a circle around it when buttoned), and the shirt didn\u0026rsquo;t have much character or develop much character over time (it was as flat as a plank of cardboard). Much more recently, I got a shirt from Kamakura, at yet another higher price point, but the jump was noticeable, yet again. Besides the same quality improvements present in the Uniqlo shirt, this shirt\u0026rsquo;s fabric was thick and stiff, and it softened after wearing it and washing it over and over again, giving it lots of character. It also has an incredible collar roll and makes me feel great whenever I wear it. After having tried other OCBDs, this has become my current favorite, and is one of the garments that I keep going back to when I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what else to do.\nA white OCBD shirt. The wearer has a dusty yellow chore coat draped over his shoulders and has his white shirt tucked into a pair of dark blue trousers. His shirt sleeves are cuffed and the shirt itself looks somewhat rumpled and relaxed on the wearer. Pulled from Kamakura Shirts. While each jump in clothing quality gave me a noticeably different change in feel, the outward appearance probably changed less drastically. At the end of the day, they were all OCBDs. Now, if I were to go for an even higher-end OCBD, like say one from Drake\u0026rsquo;s, there will certainly be some minor visual changes, but I imagine that most of the value of that shirt will translate into how it feels on the person wearing it. At this point in the quality/price dichotomy, most of the changes will be something experienced by me the wearer, rather than the viewers.\nRecently, I was watching a video by Brandon Acker, where he was talking about a series of different guitars at different makes. At one point, the co-host, Marshall Brune, notes that \u0026ldquo;the first $5000 are for the audience, all the rest is for the artist\u0026rdquo;, highlighting how the sound the guitar produced didn\u0026rsquo;t change much after spending about $5000 on a guitar, the remaining you spend is on enhancements that only you will notice. This immediately felt familiar to my experience with clothes. For the first maybe $100-$200, the external differences of those OCBDs were probably noticeable, but after a certain point, much of the differences will be felt by you. You will notice minor fabric differences, you will notice the comfort of your clothes, and you will notice the fit of your clothes. All of these are things that you will notice more and more with very high quality clothes.\nA cashmere poncho from Brunello Cucinelli FW25. It costs $5,800. The outfit involves a charcoal grey denim shirt with generous squared chest pockets tucked into wide and deeply pleated grey wool pants that are kept up with a long black braided leather belt that drapes outwards. Over top is a soft grey blanket-like poncho with fringes that makes the wearer's otherwise sharp outfit look softer. Pulled from Brunello Cucinelli. People like to make jokes about the high cost of t-shirts and other garments from brands like Brunello Cucinelli. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that price is worth both the value of the garment and the idea of what you are buying into, but I know that the person wearing that t-shirt probably feels something different than when they are wearing a t-shirt from Uniqlo, even if externally we don\u0026rsquo;t notice many differences. Sometimes, some of the value we have in a garment is in the personal feel of wearing it.\nThis probably varies more than I am presenting here. There is, for sure, not a strict correlation between the personal feeling of wearing a garment and the price of that garment, or even the quality of that garment, this is just something I had noticed with clothes that I was purchasing and wearing. This is partly why you should always try on clothes before you buy it, the totality of a garment is much more than just the way it looks.\n"},{"id":102,"href":"/blog/this_latter_interest/","title":"This Latter Interest","section":"Blog","content":"\rThis Latter Interest\r#\rAugust 5, 2023\nChicago, IL\nIt often comes to me that I worry about what major decisions I have made for myself in the past that I really have little power to change. The most prominent perhaps of these was my decision to pursue Computer Science. I did, indeed, used to enjoy technology when I was a younger fellow, but as time passed, I had teachers and professors that consistently, compounded, pulled me towards the arts. Whether that was in relation to history, fashion, or, most prominently, writing. This latter interest is a curious one. For my chosen field, my writing ability is a bit of an anomaly. This is not to say that it is any good – you who have read my other work (to the nameless reader who, if all is well, does not and should not know who I am, but in all likelihood is one of less than a biscuit tin of people aware of my nebulous and ill-formed thoughts – and to you if that is you: thank you for knowing me!) would certainly be able to agree with me on this – but that it is of an, at least, minutely improved ability over my technological peers (of which you have likely realized is due to my overly flowery language that seeks to dazzle, but not to mean or explain). To make up for this, however, I am granted a significant lack in ability in my chosen field. I am, by no means, an absolute wretch at the subject, but I am, especially when in the minute gatherings of the few that for some God knows reason have chosen to be aware of me to a greater level than I myself am comfortable with (I provide the sound feeling of discomfort to myself on many a weekend night), not good enough. This is compounded with the people that I know, of greater skill levels in this field at this age than I may be able to ever achieve in anything ever. The numbers of these people and their grandeur in the subject appears to me to be increasing continuously. I don’t know if its something about me that ends up in their company, or if it’s simply…something else. I am fine at this subject, I know that, but clearly I am not in the right frame of mind to be in this subject. I wasn’t necessarily forced into it, I chose it of my own accord, but really I chose it for realism, or because it was within the scope of what others called realism (their scope included one other field). Am I interested in it? Probably, I do still on occasion find interesting things, and I am averted towards things I find interesting by those I know, but I don’t feel any need to learn it, beyond just what I need to survive whatever number of years at a job. The other interests I find much more intelligible, and I find myself relishing their presence more than ever as the time passes and as my conaissance with the impressives continues. And thus I have my latter interest, which compels me to be myself – lazy, indecisive, apologetic, confusing without reason, wanting to please – and sell that, if I want it to be present, or really if I want it to exist and to outlast me. I want to know that what I am writing is meaningful or at least is graced and affirmed by the eyes of someone who understands or appreciates. So I want the output of that latter interest to be good, but I can’t forget who I am; I also want to be over with it – to have sent it out there and to not see it again in my inbox. And I don’t want to have to hold it high above my head in the crowd of others and recite it to an audience to be accepted into their community as one from the beginning, and not a confused little rabbit seeing carrots in multiple directions thinking he can only move in one. I’m not sure if I want to end up the Sancho Panza realist and continue through my chosen field and discover (as Don Quixote never does) that life is dull and dreary, and filled with people ready to find humor (and especially monetary value) in your strong delusional belief to the contrary. I want to send out my work, hold it lightly in hand, and deliver it to someone who finds it interesting, and can parlay it to the world. Instead, I see my own work in my inbox, as many others do. I want to know that I can make you feel, that I can help you find meaning, or that I can help you yell inside the depths of your mind what you didn’t know how to phrase but knew so dearly and so desperately to be true. That you are alone and that the only way you think you can somehow help people or find meaning in your own life or find some people to be in good humor with is by creating things. But you know that those things are quite frankly not very good, and that you aren’t sure ever will be good. And even with all that, you don’t know if you want your work to be found, if you want it to be meaningful to some people, or if you just don’t want to be forgotten and you just want the people around you, sparse though they may be, to love you (and by God it is even hard to type those four letters), if not just find you to be an agreeable person.\n"},{"id":103,"href":"/blog/trend_cycle_thoughts/","title":"Thoughts on Trend Cycles","section":"Blog","content":"\rThoughts on Trend Cycles\r#\rMay 13, 2025\nNowhere in particular\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been, sadly, using Instagram more than I\u0026rsquo;d like to be as of late, and this has bombarded me with a great deal of fashion and fashion advice content. My experience with fashion advice has always been somewhat wrought, just due to the sort of expectations it lives by. I got into fashion in high school, and so have had a lot of time to mess with my style and experience a lot of failure and bad outfits. Evetually this has brought me to something I am somwhat comfortable with, but there are a lot of things I\u0026rsquo;d like to change. I would probably consider fashion to be a hobby of mine by this way, mostly because of the amount of time I have spent learning about fashion and messing with clothes. This is not to say I am an expert or even know a lot. Every time I do see some video/reel/article about fashion online, I am astounded by how little I know and just how big fashion as a subject is.\nI find that a lot of this content online (at least the content targeted towards men and men\u0026rsquo;s fashion more generally) seems to be teaching people style through very quick blurbs. This is pretty similar to what I had experienced in high school, too, just in the form of Youtube videos and blogs. There is nothing inherently wrong with this and I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to write these pieces of advice off like they\u0026rsquo;re worthless. There is a lot of incredible advice online in every format (be it through reels, videos, articles, etc.), and I have learned a lot from each of these formats.\nSomething interesting I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed lately, though, is that a lot of men dress pretty similarly, and a lot of the advice given here (especially from gen-z content creators) kind of output similar styles. The one I\u0026rsquo;ve seen most commonly is the \u0026ldquo;big pant and small shirt\u0026rdquo; (with variants), which has become popular everywhere. What felt to me like a thing only relevant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, suddenly became an internet-wide phenomenon.\nI'm not going to put a picture here because I don't want to attack any specific creator, but you can google \"big pant small shirt\" to get an idea of what I mean. None of these outfits are bad, I actually like a lot of them and have worn outifts pretty similar in the past, its just interesting how all of the outfits kind of feel the same.\nA lot of the advice themselves, though, is pretty similar to what I saw in high school, it\u0026rsquo;s just that the aesthetic has changed. So instead of favoring \u0026ldquo;slim pants long shirt\u0026rdquo; we now have \u0026ldquo;big pants small shirt\u0026rdquo;.\nHarry Styles back then Harry Styles now Back in high school, I remember the advice generally followed the trajectory of \u0026ldquo;fit, fabric, and function\u0026rdquo;, and I feel like this is still true to some degree with advice I see today. Of course, there are many flaws to this \u0026ldquo;trifecta\u0026rdquo;, but so be it.\n\"Fit\" back then meant that clothes needed to hug your body, because slim was in and the de-facto \"good look\".\r\"Fabric\" just meant wearing the right materials for the weather / use case / outing.\r\"Function\" meant the clothes you wore needed to have a reason for being worn, so neckerchiefs were not allowed.\rThat last one ignored that fact that ties are, in fact, no longer useful anymore, but for some reason it got a pass.\nThis is decent advice (albeit generic), and so too is all of the varying advice that comes from it. I often see people talking about \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; the most out of all of these, and that\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s probably the most fun to talk about. Silhouettes are cool and it\u0026rsquo;s fun to joke about bad silhouettes. My frustrations mostly surround discussion of \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo;, and while I do have a lot of problems with the other two prongs, I think fit, as a point of discussion, tends to be the one we have the most feelings about.\nAt the current moment, wider fits are the fashion norm and people love to deride skinny fits, making fun of them for \u0026ldquo;looking bad\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to defend skinny fits, I just want to say what I feel. I know that back in 2016, I thought that the skinny fit and the good outfits that came from it looked incredible, and I also know that now in 2025, I think that the wide fit and the good outfits that come from it look great. In the same way, I thought that wide fits looked bad in 2016 and now I think that skinny fits look kind of bad in 2025. This sort of cyclical approach to fashion and silhouettes is normal and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with changing your opinions on style here, I just don\u0026rsquo;t like the absolute correctness that people feel with the style that they like the most.\nMarcelo White. Is this this outfit absolutely correct? Thanks to the neckerchief would you consider it bad? Something that bothers me are the people and influencers that gave style advice back in the 2010s whose advice I followed are now giving the stylistically opposite advice, but still framing their opinions as fact or in absolute certainty. I don\u0026rsquo;t want, again, to point out any specific person here, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen plenty of skinny derisions online (and if the algorithm thinks you like fashion, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen it too). I get that we\u0026rsquo;re all just going with the trend (I, too, own some wide pants), but surely we should all know by now that none of this is fact and everything we\u0026rsquo;re doing when it comes to style is purely vibes based. Trying to put a \u0026ldquo;scientific certainty\u0026rdquo; or making just claims about how the current style that your are espousing is the right way to do things lacks some awareness.\nIn 2016 I remember hearing advice about how everybody should wear skinny clothes regardless of their body type. Specifically,\nskinny people trying to look less thin by wearing baggy clothes just look skinnier, so they should just wear skinny clothes\rbigger people trying to look skinnier by wearing baggy clothes don't look good, so they should just wear skinny clothes\rand so on. Clearly looking back on this, we can see this as bad advice because plenty of people are now out and about wearing wide silhouettes regardless of body type and look great while doing that. I should also say that I am probably just saying that because now I\u0026rsquo;m culturally attuned and steeped in a world where baggy jeans are the norm.\nTaken from Popeye magazine. Does this outfit being wide have a negative effect on how you perceive this person? Would it be better if it was skinny? Nowadays, I tend to hear things like\nskinny clothes are incredibly uncomfortable and they are hard to put on\rskinny clothes don't work for the majority of body types\rWhile both of these points have merit, are they both not also just due to our current cultural misgivings? I hear so many millennials and older Gen z who say that they\u0026rsquo;d never go back to skinny jeans because they\u0026rsquo;re so uncomfortable and it was so hard to put them on. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember this really being an issue for anyone back then, though, and really all those jeans had some degree of elastane in them so they would stretch around your body and be reasonably comfortable.\nWith respect to that last point, one very good argument against skinny clothes, though, is that they over-rely on plastic-based materials in order to provide the stretch needed to make certain slim clothes comfortable. This being bad for the environment, specifically.\nI still like this outfit, even though it might be skinny. Does that really matter here? The best take on the skinny silhouette I\u0026rsquo;ve heard so far is by Nicolas Gabbard at Husbands, who said in his interview on Throwing Fits:\nThe last big thing in tailoring was Heidi Slimaine at Dior...suddenly tailoring was relevant again. You know, he managed to do this with [a] body that doesn't exist. I started to understand the way that Heidi was working and it was about fantasy and it was about dreaming, and that's the world of fashion, and tailoring is real body...Then, of course, the market, which is always lazy, copied this silhouette, but this time for [the] real body. And then it ruins the silhouette.\nThese are the best arguments I\u0026rsquo;ve heard against skinny silhouettes so far, but even this is born of the current cultural moment. I could argue that there is also a \u0026ldquo;perfect body\u0026rdquo; for a wider silhouette, as I do see some people wearing the same outfit better than other people. At least to me, taller people get away easier with wider clothes than shorter people, but even that isn\u0026rsquo;t a standard (just in the same way that skinnier people don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily look better in a slim silhouette). Surely in another decade or so, we\u0026rsquo;ll see Gen alpha kids saying things like\nwider silhouettes are a waste of fabric and energy/materials needed to produce that garment\rwider clothes are a hallmark of conservatism\rand whatever other arguments feel relevant to their time.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it really matters whether you prefer a skinny silhouette or a wide silhouette, I\u0026rsquo;d just like people to recognize that their preference was probably birthed out of a \u0026ldquo;cultural moment\u0026rdquo;, rather than objective fact.\n"},{"id":104,"href":"/blog/transportation_and_clothing/","title":"Transportation and Clothing","section":"Blog","content":"\rTransportation and Clothing\r#\rSeptember 4, 2024\nBlanchard\u0026rsquo;s Coffee\nI came across a fairly interesting discussion on transportation recently, on an old episode of 99% Invisible (Missing the Bus). I recommend listening to the episode or reading the article, both because it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting but also because I will be somewhat paraphrasing some of the ideas expressed within.\nObviously 99pi. The part of the article/podcast that I found the most interesting was that which discussed the cost of public transportation. Most transportation agencies have some sort of discount on passes if you buy them for a specific timeframe. For instance, in Chicago a monthly pass for the CTA is about $75, but an individual one way ticket is $2.50, this means that you can recuperate your costs after only 30 train rides. I used to take the train and bus a lot in Chicago so this option saved me a lot of money.\nThe beautiful El train (I miss Chicago) However, the book covered in the article, Better Buses Better Cities, claims that low-income riders cannot afford a monthly pass, and so they end up being used by wealthier riders, simply because low-income riders may not be able to afford a pass up-front, while wealthier riders can. There are solutions to this in the world of transportaion, the article brings up \u0026ldquo;fare capping\u0026rdquo; in particular, but this idea of affordability itself was fairly interesting to me and reminded me of something similar in the world of fashion.\nWithin the world of fashion and overconsumption, there exists a fairly commonly stated concept that goes along the lines of \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s cheaper in the long term to buy one good quality shirt at a higher price than five lower quality shirts at a lower price\u0026rdquo;. The quantity of clothing, the type of clothing, and the prices all differ, but the general idea is often the same: it is cheaper to buy higher quality clothes in the long term than cheaper clothes. The reasoning behind this is that the higher quality piece of clothing will last you longer than the cheaper one, so then you will have to keep replacing the cheaper one, which can end up costing more money. For instance, I could buy one good high quality white shirt for $100, which will last me 5 years, or I could buy a $30 white shirt which will only last me one year. This platitude is mentioned so much, but is it really true?\nWhat I talk about here may somewhat disagree with what I stated about quality in my previous article, but I think that take had a bit less nuance than it probably should have had. I still abide that in general the quality of a piece of clothing will increase with the cost, but there are a lot of limits to this (it is indeed a fairly theoretical take). At some price point, the quality of a piece of clothing takes less value in the cost of that piece of clothing than the brand name or exclusivity associated with the piece. Additionally, brands may sometimes price similar clothes with different levels of quality the same (I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any examples off the top of my head, but this was brought to my attention thanks to Jennifer Wang\u0026rsquo;s work and videos).\nThe quality of Hermes is almost insane, and it's somewhat incredible to learn how much goes into clothing and accessories at the Atelier. Hermes might be in the upper eschelon of quality vs. label, but the label certainly does a lot. Here\u0026rsquo;s where that transportation stuff comes in. Lower-income people can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make the same \u0026ldquo;up-front purchase\u0026rdquo; of a $100 white shirt, just as they can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make the same up-front purchase of a monthly public transportation pass.\nDo note! I do know that fashion is not as important as transportation! Transportation is something of a necessity and clothes are fairly trivial. I just found the comparison interesting. I feel like sometimes that if you are not careful with how you present the ideas of higher quality clothes vs. cheaper clothes, you can make it sounds like it is your fault that you keep consuming low-quality clothing and are contributing to the injustices of the fashion industry, when you very well may not be able to afford higher quality clothing at all. I think it is good to point out the flaws of the fashion industry and the overconsumption that exists within the fashion community, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to tread more carefully on how we discuss it. I do think that a lot of the overconsumption issue is coming from people who can afford to buy higher quality clothes and to buy less, but who still overconsume. I think the main issue is moreso unnecessary consumption vs. the act of the consumption itself, because if we attack the act of consumption, it may seem like we are attacking all consumption, and missing that some consumption is necessary, at least with the current state of things.\nThat was a deranged amount of commas, my apologies. I could have re-written that, but I was lazy and decided to write this addendum instead. (Did I spell something wrong somewhere? Probably!) All I can suggest, then, is to learn more about the makeup of clothing, what makes clothing higher quality, and what makes it last longer. You will then be able to determine what is the best piece of clothing you can buy with the budgetary constraints that you have.\n"},{"id":105,"href":"/blog/why_san_francisco/","title":"Why San Francisco?","section":"Blog","content":"\rWhy San Francisco?\r#\rMay 8, 2024\nHappy Wok\nI traveled to San Francisco late in December of 2023. Going in, I think the only thing I heard spoken of on the six-hour drive from Los Angeles was crime, both from everybody in the car with me and from messages from friends. It felt almost like a knee jerk reaction to bring up crime whenever you hear speak of San Francisco.\nAround the time I had been to San Francisco, an opinion piece was published in the National Review, \u0026ldquo;Requiem for San Francisco\u0026rdquo;, where the author laments about the crime and unaffordability in the city (more particularly about crime, of course). Another article from the National Review (\u0026ldquo;The Left Gaslights Us on San Francisco\u0026rsquo;s Problems\u0026rdquo;) discusses similar crime related issues within San Francisco and began with a discussion of Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s words that SF felt \u0026ldquo;post-apocalyptic\u0026rdquo;. I will say that a lot of these comments, both in articles and from people I\u0026rsquo;ve talked with, don’t give a timeframe for when “SF was safe/healthy\u0026quot;, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly just \u0026ldquo;SF is so dangerous/bad now\u0026rdquo;. Everything I’d heard kept turning around in my mind, so I want to understand why people feel this way, because when I was there, I hadn’t seen or had many issues to speak of.\nFirstly, a lot of what I hear about San Francisco (or really any American city) is hearsay without much information or numbers to back it. We can level this with data from the FBI\u0026rsquo;s Crime Data Explorer targeted towards the San Francisco Police Department ending at the year 2022.\nViolent Crime in San Francisco, 2012-2022\rThis is what all violent crime looks like in San Francisco between 2012-2022. The quantity of reported crimes in 2022 is 5,323 and we can overall see that the quantity of crimes has remained fairly level over time, even going down a bit in 2020, which is particularly interesting when compared to the entirety of California when it comes to all violent crime.\nViolent Crime in California, 2012-2022\rIn California in general, we can see a general increase in crime over time, most prominently around and after the pandemic and after 2014. This itself contrasts quite heavily with San Francisco. It is interesting, firstly, that violent crime increased at a greater rate of change in California in general than in San Francisco.\nOf course, cases of all property crime are higher than that of violent crime, San Francisco\u0026rsquo;s property crime looks as follows.\nProperty Crime in California, 2012-2022\rThe fluctuations are less intense than with the other graphs, but we can notice overall that property crime in the city is much the same as it has been for the entire decade.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take these datasets back quite a bit.\nProperty Crime in San Francisco, 1985-2022\rProperty crime in San Francisco has been the lowest overall in the 2000s (in this timeline), whereas the periods of time before and after have higher levels of property crime, though it is somewhat lower now than it was in the late 80s and early 90s.\nViolent Crime in San Francisco, 1985-2022\rViolent crime in SF has been overall trending downward. Noticeably, it was quite high in the 80s and 90s, but has been falling reasonably consistently ever since. The same is true with California in general. The primary distinction between California and SF on this metric is property crime. Where California has been overall trending lower over time, whereas SF\u0026rsquo;s property crime has gone up from the 00s.\nProperty Crime in California, 1985-2022\rWhat if we were to consider homelessness? This is another issue that brings a lot of ire to people with claims that homelessness has gone up a lot in San Francisco.\nHomelessness in San Francisco, 2005-2022\rFrom this graph from the SF government, we can see that homelessness has indeed gone up in SF since 2005. I cannot find much quantitative data that goes further back than 2005, but other sources suggest that homelessness in SF has been the same (or just generally, “a lot”) for quite a long time [1], [2], [3]. I did manage to find that, according to the CDC, an estimated 6,000 to 18,000 people were homeless in San Francisco in 1990 [4]. In this case, even the lower bound of 6,000 people is about equivalent to what was found from the SF government between 2005 and 2022. And even with that, unhoused homeless persons in SF are down from 2019, and is about equivalent to the mid to early 2010s.\nOverall, homelessness and property crime are about the same or even a bit better than in the 80s and 90s (homelessness could very well even be significantly better, if the CDC estimates are accurate), and violent crime is down. In that case, it could be that people are more concerned about the increase in homelessness and property crime to pre-2000 levels than they used to be. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily strike me very much as necessary for a \u0026ldquo;requiem\u0026rdquo;, unless you considered it necessary to also give a \u0026ldquo;requiem\u0026rdquo; to SF in the 80s and 90s. Most charitably, it can be said that many of these commentators want a return to the mid-2000s, where property crime and homelessness were lower (though violent crime was about the same or even a bit higher).\nNote, however, that a lot of this commentary on SF is recent, within say the last half a decade to a decade. The commentary I was looking at and referenced earlier was from the National Review and came from the last few years.\nIn considering just the last few years then, we can first consider homelessness. The homelessness discussion I pointed out earlier has a fair caveat that homelessness is down post-2019, and the unhoused homeless population (what these commentators appear to be complaining about most prominently) is about equivalent to mid-2010s to early-2010s levels. Property crime, as well, is about the same as the mid 2010s, though higher than the early 2010s. Once again, violent crime is down, and continues to be down.\nTo me, what this really suggests is that a visitor to SF in the mid to early 2010s would have an equivalent likelihood of seeing some number of homeless persons as they would now, but there appears to be, in this commentary, a suggestion that SF used to be better.\nMy hypothesis, then, is that commentators decrying SF\u0026rsquo;s problems are truly concerned about property crime, but may be conflating it with other types of crimes or social ills. I want to preface this with that, in my opinion, telling a person that some city or place is safer than they think and that they should feel safer there is certainly not helpful, or even actively unhelpful, to understanding and resolving crime and its perceptions. If someone feels unsafe somewhere, it\u0026rsquo;s best to understand why they feel unsafe, as opposed to telling them why they should feel safe. Now, I want to give two to three reasons to back my assertion.\nFirstly, violent crime being down means that you are safer from active, physical harm against yourself. However, it is useful to know that the plurality of violent crime is committed against poor and low-income persons [5]. In that case, we can hypothesize that a majority of the violent crime that had been committed in SF, when the violent crime rate was higher, was against poor and low-income persons. My assumption is that most of the travelers to SF at that time, and especially now, were more likely of the middle class or higher classes, which are people less likely to be victims of violent crime. This assumption that the people traveling to SF are middle class or higher class is based upon research that income correlates highly with international travel [6], which I would hypothesize would hold for within-USA travel as well, though granted probably to a less prominent degree. In that case, violent crime, while still certainly a concern for travelers, is not as prevalent among the types of populations that travel to SF or among the commentariat of SF\u0026rsquo;s woes, as among other groups.\nSecondly, violent crime is not necessarily as visible as property crime to travelers and general people. It can be seen in the charts above that violent crime is numerically significantly lower than property crime, which suggests that you have a higher likelihood of seeing property crime (or being a victim of property crime). Being a victim of property crime surely makes any place that the crime was committed in feel unsafe, this is also surely the case for people who see property crime (either in action or after the fact) in any particular location. If you feel unsafe about any particular location, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think about if you are going to be a victim of violent crime or property crime, you would be concerned about being the victim of any kind of crime. Putting it in a box would feel irrelevant in the moment.\nFor my third point, I used a dataset from the SF police department titled “Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018” [7]. I split this data up amongst the time-period from 2003 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2018 and analyzed it from there. I additionally used the assumption that people are more likely to spend time in the more touristy parts of the cities, which I presume are the police districts of Northern, Central, and Southern.\nComparing the two periods of time together, we can see that crime has fluctuated throughout the different police districts in curious ways. In this way, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to analyze much about what people (travelers into the city) see or predict what they might see. In this case, I would have presumed that there was in general a greater quantity of crime in touristy districts of the city, which would explain why people feel more in danger there, because they are statistically more likely to see more crime. But in this case, in Northern the crime is down, whereas in Central and Southern, crime is up. If you spend all your time in Central and Southern, then you are more likely to see more crime now than you would a decade ago, thus making you feel like you are in danger. However, a very large portion of people visit areas in Northern, where quantitative crime is down. It could very well be the case that crime in Central and Southern crowd out any positive effects that may have happened in Northern, or it could just be that because people are statistically quantitatively more likely to see crime overall, they feel unsafe regardless of the part of the city they would be in.\nInterestingly, crime in the Tenderloin district is significantly down, which is not something I’d ever known or heard of until I looked at the data. Still, I digress.\nFrom these three points, it strikes me as though people are feeling more crime now than there very well might be in the city. Certainly, compared to the 1980s and 1990s, SF has less crime, but in comparison to the mid-2000s, that becomes more debatable. Violent crimes have decreased in the city overall, and we see that property crime has fluctuated, increasing since the 2000s, but not more than the 80s and 90s. Visitors to the city in the 2000s coming again now, then, may very well feel less safe as they are statistically more likely to see property crime. Violent crime, however, they are unlikely to see in general (though it’s not impossible), given the average economic standing of a traveler.\nIn that case, it strikes me that the primary concern of these travelers, from what they have heard of from friends that have traveled to SF, or from their own experiences in SF, would be property crime. Then, it is possible that this property crime could be seen by them as a reflection of all crime, or all social ills present in the city. This conflation of property crime with all social ills is certainly something that can be reflected already in society itself. Consider how crimes against middle class or upper class “normal families” are much more televised than crimes against poor families. Regardless, whether these visitors and commentators feel safe or not in San Francisco does not change based upon that assertion, but it hopefully gives a potential explanation to why that fear exists and how it compares to SF’s current state of affairs.\nCitations\n[1] https://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/overview/\n[2] https://www.kqed.org/news/11765010/timeline-the-frustrating-political-history-of-homelessness-in-san-francisco\n[3] https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/06/08/1003982733/squalor-behind-the-golden-gate-confronting-californias-homelessness-crisis\n[4] https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00015783.htm\n[5] https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/hpnvv0812.pdf\n[6] https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/12/06/americans-who-have-traveled-internationally-stand-out-in-their-views-and-knowledge-of-foreign-affairs/\n[7] https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data\n"}]
