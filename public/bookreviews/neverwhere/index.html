<p><em>July 30, 2023</em></p>
<p>5/5</p>
<p>I have not read very many fantasy novels in my lifetime. Most that I have, anyhow, were written for children. The last one I can really recall reading is &ldquo;The Chronicles of Narnia&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have, however, been intending to read something by Neil Gaiman in quite a while. So it was, then, when a friend had just finished reading &ldquo;Neverwhere&rdquo; and had highly recommended it to me, that I had to give it a go.</p>
<p>I was, surprisingly, captivating immediately. I should say, the main reason that I have shied away from most fantasy is because of what feels to me like an intense worldbuilding, and lesser focus on the story. I find worldbuilding interesting, but tend to have a much greater focus on the story itself - what I want in a fantasy novel is a world that I find mysterious because not a lot of information or explanation as to its existence and every structure of being is given.</p>
<p>I was very glad to feel that this was the case with Neverwhere, there was, to me at least, a much stronger focus on the state of affairs and the story itself as opposed to a construction of the world itself. And I did like the world nonetheless! It felt very mysterious to me, and I like that not a lot was given away about it.</p>
<p>The story is brilliant though, and very satisfying to be sure. I think it feels like the perfect fantasy story to me - a story set in a fantastic setting.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
