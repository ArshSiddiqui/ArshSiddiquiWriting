This is the first book by Steve Martin that I have read, and after having been a fan of his work for quite a while, I was curious as to how his novel-writing skills may present.
This book is rather interesting. To be true, it was a fairly quick and light read, and it&rsquo;s not one of the best books of its kind that I have read before, but its not really trying to be.">

<p>This is the first book by Steve Martin that I have read, and after having been a fan of his work for quite a while, I was curious as to how his novel-writing skills may present.</p>
<p>This book is rather interesting. To be true, it was a fairly quick and light read, and it&rsquo;s not one of the best books of its kind that I have read before, but its not really trying to be. To one degree, this book does feel like life moving on, and we&rsquo;re given just a snapshot into it for someone, or really some people. This lends itself to intrigue of course, but the book did have some ingenuity to itself. I was rather surprised - at some instances the book does touch upon some rather profound statements, and every now and then, a line is read that reveals some sort of universal truth.</p>
<p>It is interesting, and I can recommend it.</p>
