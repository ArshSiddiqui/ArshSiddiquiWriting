The first time I had read this book, it was under the recommendation of a number of people I had respected, particularly my English teacher at the time. I had taken quite a long time to read it then, but the book really hit me at that time. Reading it again, it&rsquo;s probably actually hit me harder this time, but I feel like I read it too quickly, even though I still took like a month.">

<p>The first time I had read this book, it was under the recommendation of a number of people I had respected, particularly my English teacher at the time. I had taken quite a long time to read it then, but the book really hit me at that time. Reading it again, it&rsquo;s probably actually hit me harder this time, but I feel like I read it too quickly, even though I still took like a month. I wanted to read it again as part of a feeling I had to re-read a number of books that I had read back when I was in 12th grade, and I think it served its purpose to that degree, but I also feel like the time in which I had read it back then, it felt fairly relevant (that was the beginning of the pandemic, which might be why).</p>
<p>Some people might be put off by the style of writing of the author, or by the main character itself (maybe in the way they speak or something else), which I can totally understand and see. I myself was sometimes put off by certain descriptions and styles of writings at some point, but it didn&rsquo;t really hamper the experience all that much.</p>
<p>The book is an immense joy, and it&rsquo;s really quite beautiful. There are many statements of truth and love throughout the book that I really appreciated reading, and I love just the way the book feels. I remember my English teacher back then said something along the lines of how it was one of the few books that once he had finished, he had to read again - and I can absolutely see why.</p>
<p>I recommend it! Read it!!</p>
